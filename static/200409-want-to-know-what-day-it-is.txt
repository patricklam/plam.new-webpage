Hello SE Students,


My family has recently discovered the Holderness Family, who have apparently been making silly song parody videos on the internet for several years. Staying home during these pandemic times has created opportunity for lots of new material for them. Here's a spoof of Foreigner's "I want to know what love is" as "I want to know what day it is", about the lack of structure in life working from home.

Trying to create some structure and normalcy for you (and me) is one of the reasons that I'm writing you these daily letters. These are some of the kinds of things we can do to improve our mental health and wellness by creating some structure and regularity in a time of chaos. This morning my wife asked me what day it was, and I could confidently answer that today was Thursday, because I remembered writing you Wednesday's letter yesterday.

In our world of scheduling confusion, wondering what day it is, a bunch of emails have flown past me about the ECE140 final quiz. It's unclear to me, and I think unclear to many, whether it was originally scheduled for Easter Sunday or Easter Monday, but it is now on next Thursday, April 16 (or so says both the instructor and the Registrar's schedule). There have been emails from the First Year Office, the Equity Office, the SE Office, etc, etc. This all got kicked off by a parent emailing the university about the quiz date. One thing the instructor said to the SE Office is that no students had contacted him about the date.  These are challenging times, and we encourage you to consult your parents for guidance. This is a case where contacting the instructor, class reps, or SE Office directly would have been a faster resolution though. 

Those of you gazing skywards last night might have noticed the amazing pink supermoon for Passover. Passover is the first full moon after the spring equinox, and a supermoon is when the earth is closest to the earth in its cycle. These things do not necessarily coincide every year. It was an awesome sight. This is the kind of thing that computer scientists who read the book on Prof Berry's shelf could have predicted, but for me it was just a pleasant surprise because I do not yet have the book Calendrical Calculations.
