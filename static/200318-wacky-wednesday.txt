Hello SE Students,

“It all began with a shoe on the wall. A shoe on the wall shouldn't be 
there at all.” A great opening line from a classic book your parents 
probably read to you when you were a child. Another great distraction.

Back to our regularly scheduled program:

  * *Border "closed": *In international governmental news today, as I'm
    sure you're aware, the Canada-US border is "closed" to all
    "non-essential" traffic. Unclear what exactly that means. Does it
    apply to the new researcher that my wife's lab hired who is supposed
    to immigrate to Canada from the US on Friday? Does it apply to you
    attempting to go south with that J1 you can't get right now? Who knows.
  * *ECE Coronavirus website: *This is new. Mostly engineering-specific
    academic stuff.
      o https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/faculty-and-staff-0/covid-19-information-ece-faculty-and-staff

  * *UW Coronavirus website: *This is old, but is the official site for
    the UW-wide official news.
      o https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/
  * *S20?* If you want to talk about what S20 might look like, please
    contact Derek, Victoria or Shaz.

*SE2020*: I'm hoping to get some stability in childcare organized 
tomorrow, so then we can start to plan. Right now it's day-to-day. As 
you might be aware, all March Break camps have been cancelled, all 
public schools are closed, etc. I'm excited to hear about your projects. 
Yes, you should give a (virtual) practice talk to your peers. Pay 
particular attention to the narrative structure that you choose for your 
talk. Discussed in Communication chapter of Handbook (and in class, back 
when that was a thing). Hoping to write something longer tomorrow.

*Everyone:* SE2020 Symposium "Day" is obviously not going to be like 
anything previously. Maybe you can watch remotely. We'll try to figure 
it out.


"Only twenty more things will be wacky", he said. "Just find them and 
then you can go back to bed."

Best wishes,
