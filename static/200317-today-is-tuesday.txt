Hello SE Students,

"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a 
while, you could miss it." That movie could be a good distraction from 
our current situation. Distraction can sometimes be a good mental health 
management technique.

Let's see if I can recap some things that have happened since yesterday:

  * *St Patrick's Day: Don't do it.*

  * The Government of Canada urges everyone to return home. Self-isolate
    for two weeks when you get back.
      o *CECA* will give you credit for the work term. Come home.
      o *Exchange*: we will give you credit somehow. Come home.
          + Tricky: You are in Singapore, Hong Kong, or Taiwan, which
            are probably the safest places in the world. Might be a long
            time before you can come back. Official advice is to come back.
      o *International students*: Go where you feel comfortable and
        safe. Some of you are in Canada, and some are outside Canada on
        co-op. I'm not sure if you can re-enter Canada right now ... but
        you can speak to me or Victoria or Shaz or the UW international
        student office. We are officially told to not tell you what to
        do. But we are happy to listen to your concerns and talk it through.

      o *Residence: *Go home. Do not stay in UW residence unless you
        really have to. Residence is already communicating with you on this.
  * The Province of Ontario has declared a state of emergency.
      o All restaurant dining rooms + bars are closed.
      o All recreational facilities are closed.
  * University of Waterloo
      o Campus is basically closed ... everyone has been told to work
        from home.
      o CECA says you will only need 4 work terms to graduate (instead
        of the usual 5).

      o UW services that are now available online:
        https://uwaterloo.ca/daily-bulletin/2020-03-17
  * Mental Health resources:
      o Empower-Me Student care has 24/7 support via ecounselling
        https://uwaterloo.ca/waterloo-undergraduate-student-association/services/empower-me
      o Counselling has several online resources. The "Calming the
        Panic" workshop might be of particular interest
        https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services/seminars-and-workshops/coping-skills-seminars-online
      o Bounceback Ontario has free workshops for depression and anxiety
        -https://bouncebackontario.ca/

      o The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has posted Manage
        Anxiety & Stress
        <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/managing-stress-anxiety.html>
        related to the coronavirus pandemic.

        <http://ontario.cmha.ca/news/cmha-offers-tips-to-support-mental-health-amid-concerns-of-covid-19-pandemic/>
        from the Canadian Mental Health Association
      o How to prevent loneliness in a time of social distancing

Ok, that's a lot. Probably I missed something. Maybe I made a mistake. 
There are also some cohort-specific issues that I'm working on, and will 
communicate with you as they develop.

TODO: If your class reps have a spreadsheet about where you are or what 
you are doing this term or next term, please add your name to it. This 
data might be helpful for us to try to create the best possible 
opportunities for you, under the circumstances.


Best wishes,
