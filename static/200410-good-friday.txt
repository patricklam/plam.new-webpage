Hello SE Students,

I hope you had a Good Friday. Those of you studying for exams might not have noticed that today is a national holiday. Here's how SE education went at my house this morning with my six-year old:

Charlotte: [with a mischievous glint in her eye] What's 2+2?
Derek: 4
Charlotte: No! It's 22!
Derek: That's concatenation, not addition.
Charlotte: I don't know what concatenation is.
Derek: You're just the age to learn. Do you want me to write it down? 
 

This is something you need to know for when you're a programmer.
Charlotte: I'm not going to be a programmer!
Derek: Why not?
Charlotte: I'm not a machine that programs computers! I'm a human being that kicks daddy!
[Proceeds to kick Derek in the shins.]

Good luck with your studying! 

Be well, do good work, stay in touch,
Derek.
