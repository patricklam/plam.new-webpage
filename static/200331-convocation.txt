Hello SE students,

Well, today we got some sad news that has already been delivered at other universities, and that anyone who thought about it would have realized on their own: June convocation will not happen in the usual way. Still, it is tough for SE2020 to get the official news. Here is the website:

MIT made a similar announcement last week, as have many other universities. MIT President Rafeal Reif shared a touching personal experience in his letter, to let students know that it is not just at their school and not just in this year that these kinds of tragedies occur. You are not alone. Here is his story:

    The day before I was set to graduate from my Caracas high school, the city suffered a major earthquake. Buildings collapsed. There were serious casualties. Suddenly, it was impossible, physically and emotionally, to hold the traditional graduation ceremony we had all been counting on.


    I still remember the pain and disappointment â€“ so I write with special sympathy and great regret to let you know that, in a world so disrupted by Covid-19, it is clear we cannot conduct our traditional in-person celebration of Commencement, Hooding and Tech Reunions in late May.

Waterloo, like all universities around the world, will do its best to create positive graduating experience for the students of 2020.

The main academic news for those of you who are not graduating this year is that you will be able to view your enrollment appointment times in Quest starting tomorrow. 

Be well, do good work, stay in touch,
Derek.
