 Hello SE Students,

The rumour was true, and the Provost has secured the funding: tomorrow morning there will be 300 new UW co-op jobs released in WaterlooWorks for S20. These are to help UW deliver S20 online. The application window is Wednesday to Friday of this week. Then they'll start interviews. Offers will go out May 1st.

In other news, tomorrow (Wednesday) is Earth Day.

Ramadan, the holy month of Islam, begins on Thursday. Its date is determined on a purely lunar calendar. At 3:27am UTC on Thursday (which is 11:27pm Wednesday in Waterloo), nobody on earth will be able to see the moon: the earth will be between it and the sun. Then, as the moon swings around the earth we will begin to see a slim crescent moon, and this marks the beginning of Ramadan. My eyes are faded with age, and my home is shaded by light pollution, so others will see the crescent before I do.

Be well, do good work, stay in touch,
--
