Hello SE Students,

You are fortunate to have many professors who care about you. Some of them have been replying to my daily letters pointing out corrections. I will share some of those with you today.

# DHL

You are fortunate to be eligible for both the Engineering DHL and the Math DHL. Patrick Lam wrote in to remind me of that.

Last week, I wrote to you about the rules for the Engineering DHL: I wrote that a single CR/NCR grade will mean that you do not qualify. That is true to a first-order approximation, but there are some important details I heard about today:

1. If you choose the CR/NCR, then you do not qualify. If the instructor chooses to make the course grades CR/NCR, then you can you can ask the Engineering Associate Dean Undergraduate to manually do the calculations for your case.

2. If you are overloading and have a DRNA course, then that doesn't matter: it can be CR/NCR no problem. DRNA = Degree Required, Not in Average. Since it is already defined to be not in your average it doesn't matter if it has a numerical grade or not for DHL calculations.

Today, the Math Undergraduate Affairs Committee met and approved revised rules for the Math DHL. As long as you are enrolled in 5 courses and have numerical grades for at least two of them, and the average of those is at least 87%, then you qualify. Usual rules about no failed or excluded courses, no incompletes, and so on.

Now, you should understand that this is all preliminary information. It is possible that a higher level committee will change this information. And maybe I made a mistake. But probably these are the rules that will be applied in both cases.

# Date of Easter

Prof Dan Berry pointed out that I made an off by one error in describing the date of Easter. I wrote:

the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox

But really it is:

the first Sunday after the first full moon ON or after the Spring Equinox

If there is a full moon on the spring equinox then these definitions are a month apart. That's what I get for relying on Wikipedia and the popular press for technical information. Dan uses a more authoritative book written by two computer scientists, called _Calendrical_Calculations_, which is full of algorithms for doing all of these calculations. 

    https://www.amazon.ca/Calendrical-Calculations-Nachum-Dershowitz/dp/0521702380

It looks like a really exciting book that covers calendar systems from many cultures. I hope I get a chance to work it into some of my teaching sometime. Maybe I can use some of the algorithms from this book as example code in my compilers class.

# Face Masks

Today Canada's Chief Medical Officer of Health recommended that Canadians wear homemade cloth masks while in shared public spaces such as grocery stores. The Centers for Disease Control has made a similar recommendation for Americans. The purpose of these homemade masks is not to protect the wearer, but to prevent the wearer from inadvertently infecting others. 

I am using my daughter's old T-shirts. Just enough of my head can fit through the neck hole so that I can see. It's an exciting new accessory to my outfits. When I went to the LCBO, I wore a black-and-white striped one to look like a robber. When I went to visit the old lady (at an appropriate physical distance) who lives down the hall, I wore one with pink hearts. Have fun with your new fashion accessory when you go grocery shopping.

Be well, do good work, stay in touch,
Derek.
