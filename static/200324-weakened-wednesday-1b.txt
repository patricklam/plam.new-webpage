 Hello SE2024,

Two extra things for you:

Option to withdraw one course if your midterm average is below 60%

If your midterm average is below 60% then we will permit you to withdraw from one course --- but not CS138.  This is an accommodation that we usually explore through personal meetings in the Software Engineering Office.  Obviously we cannot do that this term; hence this email. There are about 15 students in this situation.  If you withdraw from a course now, you will need to take and pass that course in the future.

Note that failing a course is not a big deal.  So long as your term average is above 60% and then you are promoted to 2A.  You will write a supplemental exam for the failed course in the future.  Writing the supplemental exam is less work than taking the entire course again.

ECE124 Update

Prof Mathai and I had a chat this morning. He is happy to accommodate your request (in your letter) to extend the time for the final two assessments. Also per your request, I will ask Prof Kennings to do the same for his section. Prof Mathai will also create some practice assessments for you.

Prof Mathai has been very responsive to students who have posted questions in the LEARN forum on via email. I encourage you to engage in these ways. Maybe you feel shy --- I did when I was in first year. Maybe you can ask one of your friends or class reps to post your question for you.

Prof Mathai really cares about your learning. And he is a master of this material: he works in this area every day, and is teaching you things that are relevant to modern professional practice. I encourage you to engage with him and the material.

Prof Mathai and I are also exploring a few other ideas.


Be well, do good work, stay in touch.
Derek.
