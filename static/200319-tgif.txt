Hello SE Students,

Thank goodness it's Friday. Hopefully a day where we can start to 
decompress a bit and take stock of what we know and what we've learned. 
As of this afternoon, we have some greater certainty on a few big issues:

  * https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/ has all the details, which I
    summarize here.
  * *S20 will be online*.
      o All courses and exams will be online. No in-person meetings.
      o Dates shifted by a week: Starts May 11, ends August 4th.
      o More info to come from the UW President next Friday.
  * *Most of campus will be locked up on Tuesday.*
      o A few buildings will still be open during business hours: E5,
        E7, M3, QNC, SLC, some others.
      o Importantly, DC and MC will be completely locked. Even faculty
        will require a police escort to enter.
  * Co-op academic flexibility:
      o You have 6 work terms scheduled. Usually you need 5 jobs in
        order to graduate. That number is being reduced to 3 or 4 ...
        I'm a little unclear on whether it's 3 or 4.
      o For S20, CECA will accept 8 weeks of employment for co-op
        credit. So just July+August. Usually they require 12 weeks for
        academic credit.
  * Co-op: international work terms.
      o My understanding of the UW President's words is that CECA is
        communicating with employers about the possibility of you
        working from home in Canada.
      o Monitor WaterlooWorks for messages.

Off-campus news highlights today:

  * Know anyone returning from March Break? *Urge them to self-isolate.*
  * Ontario has 38 testing centres.
  * Some local distilleries have shifted from making booze to making
    hand sanitizer.
  * California is shut down.
  * New York State is almost shut down.
  * Community transmission in Toronto.
  * The Canadian border closes to all non-essential traffic at 11:59pm
    today.
      o Canadian citizens and permanent residents can still return after
        the deadline.
      o Truckers can still bring goods after the deadline.
      o Essential workers will still be allowed to cross after the deadline.
      o Tourism is over.
      o Recreational travel is over.
      o What does this mean for students? Unclear to me at this time ...


Through this week I've been reflecting a bit on teamwork and the 
Myers-Briggs personality test. Perhaps we'll get you younger cohorts to 
do it when you get to the capstone courses. A thing that a friend 
enlightened me about in grad school is that many of the points of 
friction in my professional life are explained by my test results here. 
The Myers-Briggs test produces a ranking in four dimensions. The 
rankings are abstracted with binaries of which side of the centre you 
are on: thinking vs feeling, etc. On the first three dimensions, I score 
very close to the centre. For example, I score "thinking", but am very 
close to the boundary with "feeling". But on the fourth dimension I'm 
way out in left field: I am very "P" (for perceiving), whereas (I think) 
most technical people are "J". This "P" power is helping me this week. I 
have a very high tolerance for the unknown. I am comfortable to make 
decisions later, when more information becomes available.

On the flip side, many "J" people get really frustrated with my 
inability to make or keep a schedule. Utter failure to nail things down. 
Don't really care about many deadlines, because they are minor and 
essentially flexible. This is pretty frustrating for many students in my 
SE491 capstone course, for example.

In many contexts, I need to develop better strategies to be more "J". 
It's a lifelong struggle. But in this COVID-19 global pandemic context, 
"P" power is actually helpful, because the situation is constantly 
evolving, and plans are always provisional and often need to be revised 
quickly.

With the SE2024's we did a quick personality analysis by PowerPuff Girls 
back in SE101 last fall. Professor Utonium designed the PowerPuff Girls 
systematically: sugar (Bubbles), spice (Buttercup), and everything nice 
(Blossom). It's a simple structure we can quickly work with. The 
Myers-Briggs Test is a more sophisticated structure that is about a 
hundred years old. The Big 5 is another, more modern, personality 
assessment. One shouldn't get too carried away with these things, but 
they can sometimes provide useful insights.

In a sense, dynamic dispatch and dynamic linking and changing methods on 
individual objects, are the programming language equivalents of the 
Myers-Briggs "P": decision deferred until more information is available. 
Turing Award winner Alan Kay, inventor of SmallTalk, thinks that this 
/late binding/ is an essential feature of object-oriented languages (and 
also of Lisp).

Go for a walk through the trees and think deep thoughts about 
programming languages and personality types. It will be good for you in 
many ways.

There are a few things that I'm working on for you, which hopefully I'll 
be able to report on in the coming days. The powers vested in this 
office are those of communication and persuasion. These are also good 
powers for you to cultivate in yourself, for they will always serve you 
well when wielded with skill.

Be well, do good work, stay in touch,
