Hello SE Students,

Today is Easter Sunday for most of the world's Christians. It is the most important religious holiday of the year for Christians. Most churches would have, in any other year, been full, but today were empty.

Sunday is our day in the daily letter here to reflect and to plan. The week going forward is rather plain compared to the week that has past: there are no major astronomical or religious or academic events coming up this week; just your exams (that is, "alternative assessments"). Ah, that is not entirely true: about 15% of the world' Christians, who use the Julian calendar for religious purposes, will observe Easter next Sunday. Calendars are such interesting technical and cultural and historical things.

Reflecting on this past week, for me it was about settling in to the new normal. The intensity of the transition to working from home is mostly over. We are all stocked up. Canadian Tire stores are closed (except for curbside pickup). 

As we realize that we're in the new normal, you might discover some habits that you've fallen into that you'd like to improve. There were two great capstone projects this year connected to habit formation that might help.

One was a significant contribution to the existing open-source project Habitica, which gamifies habit tracking. I hope to try this app out with my kids this week.

Another explored a recent book on psychological research on how habits work. Apparently there is a habit loop: cue, routine, reward. Here is the website of the book's author:

In this world of social distancing, we need to make an active effort to create structure and positive habits for ourselves. This week is a good week for you to start one new daily habit that improves your mental and physical wellbeing.

Be well, do good work, stay in touch,
Derek.
