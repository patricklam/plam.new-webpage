Hello SE students,

Canada's first lady, Sophie Gr√©goire Trudeau, is officially over the coronavirus this weekend. Hooray! As you may recall, she got it in the UK a few weeks ago, and this was the cause of Prime Minister Trudeau working at home in self isolation the last two weeks (which he will continue to do, following public health protocol).

Today I did quite well on sleep, exercise, diet, laundry, and dishes. Climbed 120 stories of stairs (I live in a 40 story building), and played a bit of football outside with the kids. Not too much work though. Tomorrow the kids will go back to my sister's, and I will have more opportunity to reply to your emails. Let me make a note of that in the Daily Jog Log:

There are three things that we are expecting this week:

1. Monday is the last day to withdraw from a class without penalty. Withdrawing from a class is a rare activity for engineering students, and most students graduate without ever having done it. In most cases, you need permission from the SE Office in order to withdraw from a course. If you withdraw from a course, in most cases you will need to take that course again at a later date in order to graduate. Contact Victoria, or Shaz, or myself tomorrow if you think you want to withdraw from a course. The withdrawal deadline is not something that we ordinarily publicize to you, but today we live in extraordinary times.

2. Friday is the last day of classes.

3. S20: we are expecting an announcement about whether those of you who are supposed to be on co-op this summer but suddenly find yourselves unemployed are permitted to take courses this summer, and if so which ones.

Be well, do good work, stay in touch,
Derek.
