Hello SE students,

This morning I realized that I had made a mistake. An academic integrity violation, if you will. In Saturday's letter, I failed to give you the source of the stories. Here it is:

Academic integrity is a concern on many professors' minds these days, with our upcoming online and un-proctored final assessments. For example, the Faculty of Mathematics is working on a statement that they want all students (including you) to agree to.

The research literature shows that the best way to reduce academic integrity violations is to create a culture of trust and honesty. I hope that we have that here, and that we can strengthen it through our current experiences. Being a relatively small program gives us an advantage.

The flipside of us being a relatively small program is that when you misbehave egregiously or in public, it reflects more strongly on your peers and on the program as a whole. For example, if you make a snarky post on Reddit with the intention of being a shit-disturber, you will succeed, and cause me to have to correspond with the CS Director of Undergraduate Studies.

Completely coincidentally, Patrick Lam happened to send me a link this morning of a professor describing a culture of trust and honesty in action. That professor's university is also doing online assessments in the current circumstances. She relays a story of a student doing the right thing:

You are rightfully proud of your accomplishments --- as are your families. You want to uphold the good reputation of your peers and the program --- it creates opportunities and opens doors for all of us. Now we are in unprecedented and challenging times. I am confident that you will do the right thing.

Be will, do good work, stay in touch,
Derek.
