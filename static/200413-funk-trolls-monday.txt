Hello SE Students,

This weekend my kids rented the new Trolls World Tour movie, in which Poppy and Branch discover that there are other tribes of Trolls who listen to other kinds of music. It's a cute diversity story with, of course, strong themes of the importance of music. 

Yesterday we started learning about the Habit Loop: Cue, Routine, Reward. Music is something you can use for a cue. In society we use musical cues for many major public events: weddings, funerals, sporting events, remembrance ceremonies, and so on. Yesterday you picked a new positive habit that you want to strengthen in the context of our new normal of social distancing. Today you're going to pick a musical cue to prompt you to that behaviour.

For example, in the Trolls World Tour movie, the Funk Trolls are called to their battle stations by Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up". They are clearly well-trained and battle-hardened: when their battle hymn plays they know exactly what to do. Move On Up also contains a lyric of academic relevance for you:

    You can past the test

    Just move on up, to a greater day

    With just a little faith

    If you put your mind to it you can surely do it

Curtis Mayfield knew a thing or two about battle hymns in real life. His earlier song "People Get Ready" was used by the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr to prepare crowds for protest marches.

What musical cue will you use to build your habit loop?

Be well, do good work, stay in touch,
Derek.
