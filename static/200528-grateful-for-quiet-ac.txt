Hello SE Students,

Today I am grateful that my AC doesn't rattle so loudly.

After several years, I just finally figured out that there was a loose piece of metal that was banging against the duct, and that was what was creating the tremendous racket.  The blower is 40 years old, and so the system rattles in several places. A few years ago I used a ratchet strap to put some tension on the motor unit so that it didn't rattle the duct so much. But there was still this other rattle. Today I noticed that adjusting the fan speed had an inverse relationship to the intensity of the rattle, suggesting that there was another resonant frequency at play besides the motor itself. After a few minutes of damping vibration of various parts with my hand (don't get your fingers stuck in the motor!), I finally saw and realized the noisy contribution this loose piece of metal. I had seen that piece of metal in previous years, but hadn't fully realized it's contribution to the ruckus in my home.

So today, as the temperature rises, I am grateful to have finally figured out how to make my AC quieter.

Shaz and Victoria and today decided that we'll bring back the daily letter in this new format, as a daily gratitude journal. Research has shown that keeping a daily gratitude journal improves mental health. What we heard from your class reps today is that the inherent challenges of pandemic isolation are what everyone knows they are, and that the daily letter was a small things that was helpful to some students. So we're going to come back with this new format. We can take turns with it, and you can even send in guest contributions.

Be well, do good work, stay in touch,
