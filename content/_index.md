# Professional

I'm an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo.
I'm currently on sabbatical as a Visiting Scholar at the Victoria University of Wellington.
I am next scheduled to teach for the University of Waterloo in January 2021. That term may be remote, and so I may also be remote. Who knows?
I was the Director of the Software Engineering Program at Waterloo from 2016 through 2019.

My research area is broadly in applications of programming languages research (mostly
static analysis) to software engineering applications. I'm interested in developing novel
techniques for program analysis which take into account programmer-specified information
(language extensions, test cases, etc).

I'm always interested in taking on motivated graduate students. If you're interested in working with
me at Waterloo, send me a non-form-letter email and let's talk!

# Non-professional

I maintain work/life balance by participating in various hobbies,
particularly rock climbing and judo, and sometimes hiking and
skiing. I also volunteer with the <a href="https://ontarioallianceofclimbers.ca">Ontario Alliance of Climbers</a> as a Board member.
My <a href="/top/about">about page</a> has more details.
