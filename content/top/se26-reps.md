# Statements

## Olivia Honsinger
[[back to top]](#candidates)

*Hello again everyone!*

Glad to be joining you all in 2A! I'll cut right to the chase with my qualifications and hope what I say resonates.

As many of you might know, I have two terms of experience in both these positions. This means that I have two terms of experience reaching out to faculty and have already built good relations with them! I also have good connections within SE Soc and have proven to be a reliable resource for them when it comes to organizing events. 


I'm already familiar with how both positions work. In the context of an Academic Rep, I'm fully comfortable voicing opinions and feedback (even controversial ones) to faculty and listening to their propositions, doing my best to give input that I've observed through feedback forms and informally in our discord. In the context of SE Soc, I was able to work with the university and organize the 1B class dinner, with ~$3000 worth of funds being put towards our cohort! I've even helped the other reps organize their class campfires, as well as providing reliable documentation and resources I've used. 

As always, I'm here for anyone to talk to (and if that's not your thing, I'm more than happy to help point you in the right direction!) for various concerns — be it questions about how the universities policies and services, petitions, and other general knowledge. 

I hope to be able to serve you all again! :)


## Hargun Mujral

Hey all, it's Hargun! I'm re-running for Academic and SESoc representative, so be sure to vote for me. I'll continue to address academic concerns to faculty (as I did in our 1B term), and don't ever hesitate to message me if there are issues this term that need to be dealt with at a class-wide level. Additionally, as SESoc rep, I will continue to run events between cohorts and promote connectivity in the student body. Shoot me a message if you have any questions and I'll be glad to answer!

Hello everyone! We have finished a milestone of passing the first year and completing our first coop. I just want to say congratulations because that is a significant achievement! On to the rep elections, I have been the WiSE rep for 3 terms and would be honoured to do it for more. Now with everything in person and no restrictions, I can't wait to make lots of memories with the women in our cohort. Whether it is a board game night, grabbing food or going uptown, we will have a good time. What we do is up to you, so don't be afraid to reach out on discord. Give me the opportunity to give us memories! Have a good one. ❤️

Hi. My name is Aadila. I've done some graphic design work in high school, and I'd like to learn some photography (on my phone! No fancy camera unfortunately). I'll try my best to make it to as many SE events this term and will brainstorm hard with my fellow yearbook representatives to make the yearbook as funny and memorable as I can.
