## Sissy He

Hello people! (❁´◡`❁) Hope y’all having a great day so far! My name is **Sissy He**, and I’m running for **Academic Reps** and **Math Soc Reps** again! It was a great experience to work as Academic Rep, Math Soc Rep, and WEEF Rep last semester, so I want to keep doing it this semester! Hopefully you are happy with your last 1A term experience! 

Few reasons why I think I’m a good fit for those positions :))

* Academic Reps: Course Feedbacks to Instructors for Future Improvement
    * **I was 1A’s Academic Rep** so I’m familiar with the process 
    * **I emailed many professors about our cohort’s concerns**, and most of them got positive responses
    * **I always kept in touch with our TAs to follow up on our cohort’s progress**, and not gonna lie, they are all very proud of us! (●ˇ∀ˇ●)
    * **Other Academic Reps and I have discussed CS 138’s structure with the instructors** to help make the transferring process of the learning environment from online to in-person (especially the in-person cs exam part) becomes more adaptable.
    * I have been teaching/tutoring for more than three years**, and **I LOVE IT**
    * I have done a **Teaching Assistant Coop** this summer for a language-learning institution
    * I love to talk with my classmates and our instructors! 

* Math Soc Reps: Attend MathSoc events
    * **We all agree Prof. Ali and Math 135 are AMAZING**, and definitely we want experiences like this in the future as well! (〃￣︶￣)人(￣︶￣〃) I would take my responsibility very seriously and make sure to **maximize our benefits** from this double-faculty setup (ex. More opportunities like Math 135).

    * I always love to **discuss and argue math problems** with other people :D

Thank you so much for your time and consideration. Please contact me if you have any question or just want to chat! :)) and **please do something that makes you happy today! Also best luck with your 1B term and coop!**
