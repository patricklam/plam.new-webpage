People always ask me what to do when visiting Montreal. I did
grow up in Montreal. But, I haven't lived in Montreal since
2007. Though I've been back pretty often, things have changed.  I've
tried to look up the current state, but I am definitely out of date on some things.

I have pictures of a lot of places now, because cellphones, but not so many of
Montreal, because I mostly lived here before I had a cellphone. Still,
I found some pictures from the archives, which I've included here.

# Language

I'm writing this in English, so I should mention something about
language. Canadians should speak French (yet, outside Québec, it's
hard to get practice&mdash;but don't forget about the million
Canadians who do). But
one can get along in Montreal quite well without speaking French,
especially as a tourist. Service staff will be able to speak to you in
English.

There was a kerfuffle a few years ago about "Bonjour/hi" as a greeting.
Some Québecois purists don't like it. Quebec is not a bilingual province.

# Walking

My #1 suggestion is to go for a stroll on
Sainte-Catherine. Even when the weather is pretty hostile (February!)
there are still at least some people walking around. There are cars
(some parts are pedestrian-only some of the time now) but there
are also lots of people on the sidewalk. There are tons of stores. The
most commercial part is between St. Laurent and Peel.

These days, many streets are "[rues
piétonnes](https://montreal.ca/sujets/rues-pietonnes)" ([pedestrian
streets](https://montreal.ca/en/topics/pedestrian-streets)) in the
summer.  Sounds like a great initiative, but I haven't experienced
most of them. I can speak first-hand to the area on Ste-Catherine in
the Quartier des Spectacles and the Gay Village, starting from
Place-des-Arts and going east on Ste-Catherine for a while.
There is a page about [pedestrian initiatives for Ville-Marie (downtown)](https://montreal.ca/articles/les-pietonnisations-au-coeur-de-ville-marie-5189).
I also saw
Rue Wellington in Verdun, but not at great length.

I should mention also mention the Boulevard St. Laurent here.  There
is a lot of nightlife on St. Laurent and, to a lesser extent,
St. Denis. Historically I feel there were too many cruising cars and
not enough people walking.

# Biking

Even 30 years ago, Montreal had pretty good bicycle infrastructure.
Now it is even better. I've heard it described as "dreamy" by someone at
King Street Cycles in Waterloo. There is tons of segregated infrastructure;
even when I was a kid, it was possible to bike from my parents' place to
downtown almost all off-street, along Notre-Dame (parallel to the
Fleuve St-Laurent). It's been forever since I've been on it, but
I seem to recall separate walking and biking paths.

[bixi](https://bixi.com/en) is an extensive (docked) bikeshare system. It includes some
ebikes.  It's a good way to get out on a bicycle, though not a great
choice for, say, riding around the island.

{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/montreal-travel-info/biking" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Typical Montreal bike rack; segregated infrastructure in the far East; bikeable view onto Place Bonaventure.</figcaption>
</figure>

Montreal's bike infrastructure includes [winter
biking](https://montreal.ca/en/topics/cycling-and-bike-paths): 218km
of segregated infrastructure and 499km of painted bike lanes. The
summer total is 901km. Some parts in the periphery are summer-only
bike lanes (i.e. open to cars in winter).

## Lachine Canal

The Lachine Canal bike path is the best quick ride if you're on a
visit. It's green and by the water.  Bike to the Parc René-Lévesque at
the end, have a picnic, and bike back. The path also connects to bicycle
infrastructure at the Vieux-Port. Maisonneuve is a straight-line ride
through downtown.

## Around the island

You can ride north on Christophe-Colomb to the northern shore of the
island and the Rivière-des-Prairies. It's not particularly pretty, but
it is also a straight line.

One longer ride is to start from downtown, ride north, and then east
on Gouin along the river, turning back when you get to the eastern tip
of the island and then back along Notre-Dame. It's mostly segregated
or on low-traffic roads.

It's also possible to do a complete tour around the island, but that
gets to be a bit of a long bike ride. There isn't much commerce going around
the island, but there are dépanneurs and, on a bike, you would be able to find
(fast-food) restaurants to avoid starvation.

# Getting around

Sure wouldn't want to drive around Montreal (parking is difficult, it's slow, too many cars). Fortunately, transit is
good for most trips. Metro stations were individually designed; the
more out-of-the-way stations are more interesting looking. There used
to be a website that reviewed Montreal metro stations.

There is a weekend STM pass which is quite cheap, though many times I
get it and don't actually use transit, or I just use it to take the
747 in from the airport.

The REM regional train network is coming soon, but I don't know much about it.

# Neighbourhoods

Unlike in the "[other](#other)" section below,
I can speak at least a bit to these neighbourhoods.

* Rue Ontario (Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve): I grew up further east
than this, but my spouse lived near here for a while. This is a
more working-class neighbourhood.  The [Marché
Maisonneuve](https://www.marchespublics-mtl.com/marches/maisonneuve/)
is one focal point of the neighbourhood, though it's not quite
contiguous with Rue Ontario. Place Simon-Valois is right on Rue
Ontario. I think there is a car-free part here now.

* The Plateau Mont-Royal: Avenue Mont-Royal Est from St-Denis to Papineau
is stereotypical Montreal, and the mayor Valérie Plante was borough mayor here
before winning city-wide election. Unlike downtown, it doesn't have office
workers, but it has tons of cafés and restaurants, as well as clothing stores
and other non-chain commerce. I've never lived in the Plateau myself. Hipsters?
Find them here.

* Gay Village: Ste-Catherine east of Berri. Lots of restaurants and
  other establishments. Lively.

* Marché Atwater (Sud-Ouest): There's a cluster of good restaurants if
you leave Lionel-Groulx metro and walk south on Av. Atwater to Rue
Notre-Dame Ouest.  vin papillon and Joe Beef are famous. Also next to
the Atwater Market (haven't been there much) and the Lachine Canal
bike path. 

* Rue Wellington: In Verdun, close to the Marché Atwater. Don't know
  it super well, but looks interesting. Somehow Verdun has always been
  up-and-coming but never getting there? Is a rue piétonne.

* Rue St. Hubert: Also don't know it that well. Has its own look, with
  porticos over the sidewalk for a part. Close to the Marché
  Jean-Talon (the most famous public market in Montreal) and also to
  Christophe-Colomb.

# Points of Interest

* Mount Royal: Montreal's highpoint. From the Kondiaronk Belvedere,
views of downtown and the Fleuve. Some elevation gain; lots of
stairs. Also there is Beaver Pond. I think you can do stuff on the
hill in winter.

<br>

* McGill: the main campus is a bunch of green in the middle of
downtown (as opposed to the University of Waterloo, which has a
diminishing amount of green not that close to urban Waterloo or
Kitchener). I spent a lot of time in the basement of Burnside Hall
(Society of Undergraduate Math Students) during my undergrad. Didn't
spend much time in the Arts Building, which is the signature
building. Had an office in McConnell Engineering as a grad student and
postdoc.

* BanQ: the national (Québec) library is great, located right
downtown, though you don't get wifi access if you don't have a library
card (free for Québec residents). Also located next to the Village and
also St-Denis/Ste-Catherine.

* Vieux-Port: old buildings (on the North American scale)? we got 'em.
[Basilique Notre-Dame](https://www.basiliquenotredame.ca/fr) is the
famous church right in the middle of it.  There's also City Hall and
the Bonsecours Market, which is next to the Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours
chapel.

<br>

* [Oratoire St-Joseph](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1184):
notable building on the skyline. You can visit.

* Olympic Stadium/Jardin Botanique/Biodome: also notable building on the skyline
and a symbol of Montreal, besides the mountain. Sports complex. You can go
up the tower or walk around the botanical gardens.

# Restaurants

Sorry, been too long to give meaningful recent news. I do try to get
smoked meat [Schwartz's Deli](https://schwartzsdeli.com/) when I am
nearby, as well as bagels from either
[St.-Viateur](https://www.stviateurbagel.com/) or
[Fairmount](https://fairmountbagel.com/).  Still-open classics include
Schwartz's and [Chalet BBQ](http://www.chaletbbq.com/).  Moishes was
famous, but I never did manage to get to the location on St.-Laurent;
a new location, under new ownership, is supposed to open in summer
2023. [Beauty's](https://www.facebook.com/beautysmtl/) is a famous
brunch place; went there once.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Poulet BBQ St-Hubert and Schwartz's smoked meat (fries not in frame).</figcaption>
</figure>

I will mention some
chains. [St. Hubert](https://www.st-hubert.com/en.html) is pretty
good, focussing on chicken. It is a lot better than Swiss Chalet. [La
Belle Province](https://restaurantlabelleprovince.com/) is the
canonical greasy spoon chain, though near my parents I actually
preferred the poutine at [Josephine la
poutine](https://www.facebook.com/jospehinelapoutine/).

# Other

Off-island suburbs include the South Shore and Laval. I haven't spent
much time in Laval at all; I've biked there. I have been on the South
Shore, but not really at any places that visitors would like.
Boulevard Taschereau is my benchmark for bad urban design. There are
other such stroads in other cities around the world.

## Fireworks

That reminds me, though, of the fireworks competition.
[L’International des Feux
Loto-Québec](https://www.laronde.com/larondefr/events/linternational-des-feux)
was sponsored by Benson and Hedges when I was a kid. In 2023 it is on
Thursday nights plus one Sunday. I've never watched from La Ronde,
though you can get tickets to do so. I would usually watch from
approximately what is now the [Village au
Pied-du-Courant](https://www.aupiedducourant.ca/), which I've also
never visited. It was also possible to watch from the bridge or the
clock tower in the Vieux-Port, as well as the south shore.

# Urbanism

A few years ago, coming back from New Zealand via Montreal, I wrote a comparison of urbanism in Montreal, Wellington, and Waterloo.

* [Urban Living part I: Kitchener](/post/2021125-urban-living-part-i-kitchener)
* [Urban Living part II: Montreal](/post/20211226-urban-living-part-ii-montreal)
* [Urban Living part III: Wellington](/post/20211228-urban-living-part-iii-wellington)
