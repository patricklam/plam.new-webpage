Here's some tips for visiting Wellington. It is true that [living in
Wellington](https://patricklam.ca/post/20211228-urban-living-part-iii-wellington/)
one doesn't necessarily see all the tourist things (true of any place), but we did spend
some time touristing when we first came. (Hence many pictures here are from 2020...)

In central Wellington, everything is within walking distance. Wētā Workshop
and the Skyline track are a bit farther out and would benefit from transit, though
a few hours' walk would get you there.

# Transport landmarks and viewpoints

The [Wellington Cable Car](https://www.wellingtoncablecar.co.nz/) is
pretty famous and provides good views of central Wellington and the
harbour. It is next to the [Botanic
Garden](https://wellingtongardens.nz/).  The Botanic Garden does the
usual botanic garden stuff, including natives and imported plants.

Other viewpoints on Wellington are from [Mount
Victoria](https://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/outdoors/walks-and-walkways/across-the-city/mount-victoria-loop)
(easily accessible by car and bus) and [Mount
Kaukau](https://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/outdoors/parks-and-reserves/outer-green-belt-reserves/mount-kaukau)
(involves a decent hike up, elevation 400m). I actually quite like the
Mount Kaukau
walk [(pics)](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1334), but
it's not entirely trivial at 4km roundtrip with 300m elevation gain.

The [Wellington Railway Station](https://www.greatjourneysnz.com/destinations/wellington/wellington-railway-station/) is another transport landmark, but
unlikely to be useful as a tourist unless you want to get to the
Kāpiti Coast or Porirua (or [Auckland](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1295) via the Northern Explorer tourist train). You could use it to get to the Wairapapa, but
destinations from there are trickier (though there are wineries in
Masterton).

# Nature

I also highly recommend [Zealandia](https://visitzealandia.com/). It
has a lot of native birds, including the kākā parrot, and many other
endemic (and some imported) birds.

There are a lot of walks. I've [done
all](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1315) of the
"[Top 20 Welly
Walks](https://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/outdoors/walks-and-walkways/top-20-welly-walks)"
(in 2020). My top 2 would be the
[Skyline](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1455) and
the Wind Turbine to [Red
Rocks](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1400) Route.

For more nature, there's also islands: Matiu/Somes Island, which is
doable on a day trip, and Kāpiti Island which is a long day from
Wellington (or an overnight on the Kāpiti Coast). There is also a
pretty expensive overnight Kāpiti Island stay which I haven't done.

# Museums

OK, so we're not frequent museum visitors, but [Te
Papa](https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/) (or the Museum of New Zealand Te
Papa Rongarewa) is the museum to visit in Wellington, or maybe even
New Zealand in general. The permanent collection is free to visit;
there are rotating exhibitions which are non-free. The permanent
collection includes a colossal squid and other nature exhibits as well
as exhibitions on social history (e.g. mana whenua the world of Māori;
Pacific peoples; and about the Treaty of Waitangi) and Gallipolli.

Other museums include the [Cable Car Museum](https://www.museumswellington.org.nz/cable-car-museum/) (free), [Space Place](https://www.museumswellington.org.nz/space-place/), the
[New Zealand Portrait Gallery](https://www.nzportraitgallery.org.nz/), 
the [Nairn Street Cottage](https://www.museumswellington.org.nz/nairn-street-cottage/) (we've been to these four), and the
Wellington Museum (haven't been).

The Cable Car Museum has a lot of engineering-related information; some things
don't really change, like the 4-year work experience requirement. Space Place is
all about space and sometimes there are events where someone tells you about what's been going on.
Nairn St Cottage is a historic house and has tours with interpretation about the eras of the house,
with associated artifacts.

# Market

Whenever I can, I go to farmers' markets. The Harbourside Market is
the only easily-accessible market in central Wellington these days (open Sundays till 1 in winter, 2 in summer). There was
another market when we first came, but it got built over by condos. (It
had more fruits and vegetables but fewer food trucks.)

We always get food at the [Orange Chinese Food
Truck](http://www.harboursidemarket.co.nz/stalls/orange-chinese-food-truck/)
there, as well as a rotating thing from elsewhere, and I get various fruits and
vegetables. I have to admit that Kitchener Market is better.

Cuba Street is lively and contains the bucket fountain. Courtenay Place has a lot of restaurants but is a bit sketchy

# Movie-related sights

People have also said that visiting [Wētā Workshop](https://www.wetanz.com/) (makers of movie effects) is worthwhile; they have
[tours](https://tours.wetaworkshop.com/wellington/tours/).  I haven't
been there but my spouse liked it.

There are various Lord of the Rings filming sites in Wellington and
everywhere in New Zealand (there is the [Lord of the Rings Location
Guidebook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70990.The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Location_Guidebook)
by Ian Brodie). The [Hobbit's
Hideaway](https://cassiethehag.com/find-hobbits-hideaway-wellington/)
is on Mount Victoria though it was highly CGI'd in the movie.

There are two "WELLINGTON" signs (like the Hollywood or Amsterdam signs).
One of them is near the airport and makes fun of the wind, also near Wētā. The other one is
near the Harbourside market.
