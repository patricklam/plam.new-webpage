(Last updated January 2020).

<h2>Professional</h2>

I've been at the University of Waterloo since January 2008, now as
Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I've also
served as Director and Associate Director of the Software Engineering program.

The goal of my research is to help developers state and verify key
properties of their software; I apply static analysis techniques to
software engineering problems.

In 2007, 
I was a postdoc at McGill University's <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca"> School of Computer
Science</a>, working with the late <a href="/post/20191111-laurie-hendren/">Laurie Hendren</a>, 
<a href="http://bodden.de">Eric Bodden</a>, and
the <a href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca">Sable research group</a>.
For many years before that, I was a PhD student at MIT's
<a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu">Computer Science and Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory</a>, working
with <a href="http://cag.csail.mit.edu/~rinard">Martin Rinard</a>,
<a href="http://lara.epfl.ch/~kuncak/">Viktor Kuncak</a>, and others.

<h2>OK, how was MIT?</h2>

<p>This seems to be a frequently asked question: many people are curious to
know what it's like to be at MIT.</p>

<p>I enjoyed being at MIT; as an institution, it is extremely good (although 
not quite <a href="http://www.stanford.edu">peerless</a>) 
at collecting smart people. No, I didn't find it to be insanely competitive.
On the other hand, I do not have an insecurity complex. Interpret
my answer accordingly.</p>

<p>Six and a half years of graduate school (2000-2006), though, is a
long time (but standard in my group). I am definitely glad to be done,
and the thesis flashbacks are tapering off. I am especially thrilled 
to be back in Canada, a country from which I cannot be deported.</p>

<h2><a name="stata">Related question: How was the Stata Center?</a></h2>

<p>I liked the space a lot. We had an office (32-G730) in the Stata
Center (occupants: Viktor Kuncak, Karen Zee, Brian Demsky, Alex
Salcianu, Darko Marinov, and myself), so we didn't have to deal with
the open-plan office issues. I especially liked two things about it:
1) natural sunlight; and 2) lack of white noise. These were my two
biggest complaints about our previous building, 200 Technology
Square. A stated goal of the Stata Center was to encourage
collaboration, and its design does seem to succeed at that goal: the
numerous lounges are great places to sit and think (even if the
furniture started out as being rock-hard).</p>

<p>However, the building has to not only work as a social space, but also
as a building. In particular, buildings are required to keep the water out,
to have level floors, and to have working bathrooms. While I understand that
new buildings must generally be debugged to keep the water out, it seemed
that the Stata Center failed at keeping water out for longer than necessary,
and when I visited in 2007, I still found broken bathrooms and non-level
floors. A building may be innovative, but it must work.</p>

<h3>Comparison to the Davis Center at Waterloo (my current building)</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the hallway generates a lot of white noise, which
enters my office if I keep my door open (and I like to keep my door
open!). Not all hallways have white noise, just ours.  I don't know
why. The windows seem to block more light than is necessary, although
at least they let in some light. It seems that the open spaces in DC
do work to some extent: the atrium gets semi-regular events (e.g. our
Fourth Year Design Symposium, among others), and people do hang out in
the public spaces. Unfortunately, the open spaces don't work nearly as
well as those in Tech Square or in the Stata Center. I think that the
open spaces are too far, too open (vs. Tech Square and Stata, whose
spaces are semi-open), and they lack writing surfaces.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<p>Since I do not watch TV, I have tons of free time for hobbies. You 
will find pictures of me participating in my hobbies in <a href="https://gallery.patricklam.ca">
my gallery</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Judo: I regularly go and beat people up. I compete in tournaments,
including the 2008 Senior National Championships, in the -60kg weight
category.  Past results include bronze medals at the World Veterans championships, Veterans Nationals, Quebec provincial
championships (2007, 2008) and at the 2008 Liberty Bell tournament. Somehow there are a lot of bronze medals in my collection.
Maybe I'll get a better medal before I retire. I am a 4rd degree
black belt. I also referee, and my referee grade
is "National A".
</li>
<li>Rock Climbing: I have been climbing for fifteen years, but
of course one is never as good as one wishes.
</li>
<li>Skiing (all kinds): A more fundamental disadvantage of
Kitchener-Waterloo, and of Ontario in general, is the lack of
mountains. I like to ski bumps and trees, and am fairly competent
at skiing on downhill gear. I've been learning to ski on <a href="http://www.telemarktips.com">telemark gear</a>, 
and skiied the Haute Route from Chamonix to Zermatt. I also should go
cross-country skiing more often, but I always get blisters on the back
of my feet.
</li>
<li>Hiking:
I have climbed all 48 of
the <a href="http://www.amc4000footer.org">4000-foot peaks</a> in New
Hampshire. I led a couple of trips for
the <a href="http://mitoc.mit.edu">MIT Outing Club</a>, including some
Winter School trips (MITOC Winter School is amazing: learn how to do
winter trips during IAP!). Again, no mountains here in Ontario, alas.
</li>
<li>Free Software: I used to <a href="/top/free-software">contribute</a> to free software. It would be nice
if I had time to do that.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not quite a hobby: I get around town by bicycle. I don't like rain.</p>

<h2>Brief life history</h2>

<p>Born in Montreal and lived there for 22 years. Got a BSc in math and
computer science and an MSc in computer science at McGill. 
Went to MIT for 6.5 years and got a PhD. Achiever-type person. Hope to
convince <a href="http://mpdesjardins.ca">Marie-Pascale</a> to like Waterloo,
which admittedly is nowhere near as nice as Montreal.
</p>

<p>Provinces visited: All but Saskatchewan and Manitoba.</p>
