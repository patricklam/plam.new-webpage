# Statements

## Chris Abey
[[back to top]](#candidates)

Hey, my name is Chris and I'm running for SE Soc and Athletic Rep. Some of you may know me as Krish (that's a joke) or just another brown guy from Alberta (also a joke). However you may know me, I am a team player passionate about bringing sports to our cohort intramurals. It'll be fun seeing everyone working together and building a community. I'd also like to run for SE Soc because I'm interested in attending the meetings so you don't have to! I also attempted a dunk and here's that video:

## Avril Chen

My name is Avril and I am applying to be one of our EngSoc and Yearbook representatives for 1B. If things go as planned and everyone gets back on campus, I would like to help EngSoc organize in-person events considering how much we lack physical interactions and crave to meet people during this stressful time. It would be amazing to meet everyone and get to talk to all of you. Life doesn’t have to be something that just happens to us. So, let’s try to make the most of it by capturing the moments we spend together as I look forward to doing as Yearbook representative. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Don’t have a good day, have a great day.

Here’s the only picture of me that I can find on my laptop.

## Brandon Gartner
[[back to top]](#candidates)

Hey guys, I'm Brandon, and I'll be applying to be one of our cohort's SE Soc representatives this term.

Last semester, I was one of our SE Soc reps, where I worked on a few of the online events.  I'd like to continue with that this semester, since I don't want our 1B semester to just be a continuous stream of schoolwork with few breaks yet again.

However, if things go as planned this semester, I'd like to help SE Soc organize more in-person events, since I feel like online events just aren't as engaging as I'd like class events to be.

Thanks for taking the time to read this!

## Sissy He
[[back to top]](#candidates)

Hello people! (❁´◡`❁) Hope y’all having a great day so far! My name is **Sissy He**, and I’m running for **Academic Reps** and **Math Soc Reps** again! It was a great experience to work as Academic Rep, Math Soc Rep, and WEEF Rep last semester, so I want to keep doing it this semester! Hopefully you are happy with your last 1A term experience! 

Few reasons why I think I’m a good fit for those positions :))

* Academic Reps: Course Feedbacks to Instructors for Future Improvement
    * **I was 1A’s Academic Rep** so I’m familiar with the process 
    * **I emailed many professors about our cohort’s concerns**, and most of them got positive responses
    * **I always kept in touch with our TAs to follow up on our cohort’s progress**, and not gonna lie, they are all very proud of us! (●ˇ∀ˇ●)
    * **Other Academic Reps and I have discussed CS 138’s structure with the instructors** to help make the transferring process of the learning environment from online to in-person (especially the in-person cs exam part) becomes more adaptable.
    * I have been teaching/tutoring for more than three years**, and **I LOVE IT**
    * I have done a **Teaching Assistant Coop** this summer for a language-learning institution
    * I love to talk with my classmates and our instructors! 

* Math Soc Reps: Attend MathSoc events
    * **We all agree Prof. Ali and Math 135 are AMAZING**, and definitely we want experiences like this in the future as well! (〃￣︶￣)人(￣︶￣〃) I would take my responsibility very seriously and make sure to **maximize our benefits** from this double-faculty setup (ex. More opportunities like Math 135).

    * I always love to **discuss and argue math problems** with other people :D

Thank you so much for your time and consideration. Please contact me if you have any question or just want to chat! :)) and **please do something that makes you happy today! Also best luck with your 1B term and coop!**

## Olivia Honsinger
[[back to top]](#candidates)


**Hi there!** My name is Olivia, and I’d like to (re)run for SE Soc and Academic Rep. 

In my time representing you in 1A, I served as the Chief Returning Officer (CRO) for SE Soc. This meant I helped run elections. 
I’ve also been working with the “Softwares” team to get our SE26 cohort hoodies! Although there were less events as the term progressed, Hargun and I organized a movie and games night, where we held a Mario Kart tournament and played casual Smash on the classroom projector. I aided a small bit in the class profile for 1A, and helped keep everyone connected and organized via the SE26 Discord. 

I’ve maintained my devotion to ensuring everyone a good student experience. I began the year by organizing various events for our cohort, and near the end of the term, I worked with everyone to get our MATH135 prof Ali end-of-year gifts. This consisted of me spending the whole day bussing around the KWC area for high-quality, personal gifts from everyone. I also bought a card, and got a large amount of the cohort to sign it. The night before giving him our gifts, I was at the SLC until 4AM hand-painting a coffee mug for him, with designs and inspiration from the cohort, since he was the cohort’s favourite prof. I was also a fierce supporter of campaigning to help improve course delivery for ECE105, and kept in regular contact with our professors and program directors to ensure that the cohort was represented.

I’m sure by now, some of you may have realized that I’m rather open about my mistakes and failures throughout the term. As a result, I’ve had many of you reach out to me to privately share your similar experiences. Whether it was helping explain the process of handling a P71 accusation, dealing with feelings of inadequacy and impostor syndrome, moral support, or coping with various mental health issues, I’ve always been willing to lend my ear (and my shoulder!) to anyone who found themselves in need of it. I strongly believe that being open and accepting of failure creates a gateway to discussion, and ultimately, helps us feel like we’re not alone in having a tough time!

Please feel free to reach out to me on Discord if you have any questions. I hope to represent you again! :)

## Hargun Mujral
[[back to top]](#candidates)

Hey! You may know me as the guy on discord who talks too much. Or perhaps you know me as the 17 year old. Maybe I am a math nerd in your eyes. Or maybe, you know me as the OG Ali stan ;). However it may be, I hope you trust that I can make a good Academic and SESoc rep! So please vote me for both of these positions, and I will make sure your voice is heard. We will get through 1B together, in-person or if it must be, virtually :)

## Madison Mussari
[[back to top]](#candidates)

Hi everyone!

My name is Madison Mussari and I am running for the positions of **WEEF and EngSoc Rep**!

I want to take on a position to represent our cohort and ensure we are receiving the support necessary to make it through 1B (with the three ECE courses on our plate and our first coop cycle starting in less than a week, we are going to need it).

I thoroughly enjoyed our 1A semester, mostly due to the welcoming and supportive community we were able to create within the program. Transitioning into this term and having the majority of classes online, I want to ensure that we continue to thrive amongst these uncertain times.

### WEEF

We constantly hear the term "WEEF TAs" being thrown around by our professors, but what exactly are they? The Waterloo Engineering Endowment Foundation (WEEF) collects donations to be used to support the undergraduate community. As a WEEF Rep, I would have a say in where the funding is allocated, by submitting proposals and giving presentations to the Funding Council. I would look to poll the cohort and talk to students individually about what supports and services they would find beneficial to their academic journey at Waterloo.

Need help with ECE 106? I could ensure that the WEEF council continues to fund TAs that can help us navigate this challenging course.

Want to join design teams and other student run organizations? I could share SE student interest with the council and make sure funding is allocated to these extra-curriculars.

I am experienced in writing proposals and dealing with finances, as I dealt with grant applications and balancing the budget of my FRC team throughout high school. Furthermore, I feel comfortable giving presentations and communicating with university personnel, as this is something I did frequently as an executive member of a club at Queen's University for three years.

### EngSoc

As first-years, we have interacted with Waterloo's Engineering Society many times throughout the term, perhaps without even knowing it. From running the exam bank to giving us hard hats during O-week to running resume critiques during recruiting season (sign-up if you haven't), EngSoc is constantly supporting us. I want to offer my unique perspective to the council and ensure that the needs of SE students are heard!

Having many leadership roles in high school, I feel prepared to take on such a role and make sure that resources are available for our cohort. Additionally, being apart of Tech+ for the past two terms has allowed me to engage with the university community on a higher level, preparing me for such a position.

Thank you for considering me and good luck with the rest of the term!! :)

## Tanmay Pilla
[[back to top]](#candidates)

Hey everyone, I am Tanmay Pilla and I am here to run for Athletic Rep this winter! Athletics and sports have always been a huge interest of mine, and I am a very passionate sports fan. I spend hours a day watching or playing Soccer, Basketball and any other sport you could think of.  Trust me, I’ve spent hours watching Darts as well (yes it is a professional sport 😊). I have played soccer and basketball at the state level in high school and I am super excited for intramurals this term. I would love to organize intramurals and several competitions for our cohort as the Athletic rep!

Hey SE'26, it's Padena! I've had a lot of fun being academic rep, so I'm hoping that you consider voting for me for the upcoming term. Thanks!

## Vaishnavi Ratnasabapathy
[[back to top]](#candidates)

My name is Vaishnavi Ratnasabapathy and I want to be the Women in Software Engineering Rep and the Yearbook Rep for 1B!  

### WiSE 

I know that this term has a different feel to it since there aren't any in-person components. It feels strange, but I want to help with that. Sadly, I can't plan fun in-person events like a WiSE rep should, but we can do that online! I have some ideas up my sleeve. :) Check discord! 

* I have been very active in trying to get to know my classmates <3 
  * I will always try to say hi to everyone because I want to know everyone's name and I want people to feel welcomed 
  * Very welcoming and will always have both of my ears available to listen to your concerns  

* I was a part of a volunteer group that planned events targetted towards teenagers all throughout highschool 
  * Planning events with the other reps will be really fun and I will advertise them to everyone in our cohort + more 

* I have struggled with being a woman in STEM  
  * I can't even count how many times people have tried to undermine my admission to this program by saying, "They must have had to have a certain amount of girls in the program" or "You only got in because you are a girl" or "They needed the diversity for statistics!"  
    * By running events, I want to make sure that the women in this program don't feel like an imposter and they feel like they earned their spot like everyone else! 
    * We need to be united and support each other because we as women are the minority in engineering 
  * Trust me I have heard it all from "friends" and people from my community 

### Yearbook 

 * I love to capture moments between classmates and friends 
   *  It was my idea to take the BIG group photos at the SE picnic and our last class with Ali 
    *    WE ALL LOVE THOSE PHOTOS  
   * I don't have a camera, but my iPhone will do just fine :) 

Here is a picture of me!

## Kristof Sochan
[[back to top]](#candidates)

Hello! My name is Kristof Sochan and I'm running to be your Academic Representative and your SE Society Rep this 1B Term. 

While all of us talented SE cohort members are worthy of these distinguished positions, I'd like to touch on a few reasons of why I'd like to step up to the task of being your class rep this term.

We live in a time of uncertainty. Will the rest of the term remain online? Will ECE 106 be as painful as ECE 105? How are teachers going to accommodate our needs as we embark on our first co-op search? I seek the answers to these questions as much as you do, and my mission will be to seek out information and inform you in a timely and clear fashion.

This term is, to some people's delight, and other (most) people's demise, heavy on ECE courses. As a member of my FRC Team 254's electrical team for 3 years in high school, I think my expertise in the field will be useful when many of our questions may arise from any of our three ECE courses. I will be your pipeline directly to the ECE, and of course the Math and CS, departments, for any concerns you have about our classes.

I pledge to be a responsive, available, and approachable representative for you all this term. If you elect me as your representative, I will keep my phone ringer on for you to wake me up at 3:00AM if you need, or you can come to my room in REV and break my door down if necessary. I will be here for you. My grind to be your best representative will never stop.

## Tina Wang
[[back to top]](#candidates)

Hello! My name is Tina Wang, and I’m running for **SE Soc Rep** and **WiSE Rep**. Here are a few reasons why I think I’m a good fit for these roles:

* **SE Soc**: As an exec in student-led service organization in highschool, I helped organize many events (Christmas party, non-slip sock making, etc.), and **accommodated for both virtual and in-person students** as an exec.
* **WiSE**: I worked for the ForUsGirls Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that seeks to provide leadership development programs for young womxn and girls, for several months. My goal is to **run events that make women in our program feel like they belong**, and that builds a strong community within the program across cohorts.

I learned first-hand from these experiences that it’s your voices that matter! If elected, I will voice your ideas to the best of my abilities and make sure they’re heard. 


Thank you for your time and consideration. Here’s to the best term yet 🥂


Cheers,

Tina
