Aside from COVID, the other that I'd been avoiding restaurants was my
goal of fighting in the NZ judo nationals, which was in Christchurch
in mid-October. Actually, they had the South Island Championships, and
then the North Islands two weeks later, and then the nationals three
weeks after that. This was in fact the first time that I'd fought in
-60kg in NZ, though I had worked to get to -60 for Canadian senior
nationals this May. Unlike at the North Island championships (failed
water loading leaving me at 61.5 morning-of), this time I made it.

To my surprise, there were 9 men in -60, and 10 in -66 (which had been
surprisingly strong at the South Islands). I'd never seen 9 -60s in
this country.  Anyway, I got thrown with a drop seoi 1 minute into my
first match. I had had a good sequence in ground work, but didn't manage
to capitalize. The two matches in the repechage were against
less-experienced competitors. I wasn't messing around, threw one guy
for the full point, and threw and pinned the second guy, for (yet
another) bronze. The gold medal match didn't go the way I thought it
would. Sadly, I wasn't in it; our half of the draw was strong.

The Wellington Judo Academy did quite well at nationals, winning 20
medals. Most people fought in multiple divisions, but I only did
seniors. Could do veterans, but -73 isn't good for me (better than open,
but still).

I didn't have a huge amount of time in Christchurch. Transit isn't
quite as good as I'd like, so I supplemented with neuron
e-kick-scooters to do last-3-miles at times. I stayed at Designer Cottage,
an old-school B&B run by Steve and his partner (Chet from Malaysia, if I
recall correctly?). Highly recommended.  It's a shame I had to miss
the breakfast on Saturday (no way I'd make weight) but it was tasty on
Sunday and Monday. 

Also, there were some people flying out early on Saturday
morning. Somehow they didn't clue into the "being quiet at 5am" thing.
Until I knocked on their door and said "It's 5am. You have to be
quiet." Over the next few days, I got positive feedback from the other
guests about that.

There was another athlete staying at the Cottage as well, from
Tahiti. He had just won some race on Sunday. And there was a guy
coming in from Japan to go see stars at the Mt. John observatory near
Tekapo.

Walking back from Saturday dinner at Lone Star (hard to seat a large party even in
Christchurch, but not awesome; 9 ribs is twice as many as I can
handle, and was also Sunday dinner), I ran into referees from
Australia Serge and Sam (actually a NZer), who were staying close by.

On Snuday afternoon, I had time to take the Christchurch Tram (last
departure of the day). Not transit. It does a 4km loop in 50 minutes
with commentary along the way. I guess I'd do it once, but not really
again.  Turns out that they've recently added 600m of track. After
riding the tram I enjoyed an ice cream cone. Now, if only there was
actual rail transit in Christchurch again.

Finally, on Monday morning I walked to the bus stop and then took the bus back to 
the airport, which worked well enough I guess. My camera stayed at Designer Cottage
(under the chair); huge props to Steve for mailing it to me! (and fewer props for
NZ Post for taking a while to mail the package).
