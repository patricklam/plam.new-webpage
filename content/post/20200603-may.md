It's astonishing how quickly things have returned to almost-normal in
this country. Since May 14 (3 weeks ago already!), we've been in <a
href="https://covid19.govt.nz/alert-system/alert-level-2/">Alert Level
2</a>, where most things are open. Physical distancing, capacity
controls and mandatory contact tracing remain for now, although there
will be another decision next Monday, June 8. The number of known
active cases is 1 and the last positive reported case was on May 22.

# Haircuts

I had been planning to wait a few more days, but I was walking down
the street and noticed a barber open with no line, so I've had
reasonable hair since May 17.  The Onward deadline was with too much
hair, but the OOPSLA deadline had the right amount of hair. Very
important when spending hours at the computer. Looking through the
records, it looks like I feel like I need a haircut after 6 weeks and
then wait another 2 weeks to actually get one: Sept 5, Nov 5, Jan 7,
Mar 3, May 17. The 10-week interval was excessive.

My hair's still a bit long so I may actually run closer to 6 weeks
this time. One thing I'd been wondering was whether my hairline was
higher than it used to be, or whether I'd just always been getting
haircuts with shorter hair in front. The current state of my hair
suggests that it's the haircuts, not the hairline.

# Professional

Submitted 2 papers, punted 1 towards ICSME NIER track.

<ul>
<li> Patrick Lam, Jens Dietrich and David J. Pearce. Putting the Semantics into Semantic Versioning. Submitted as an essay for Onward! '20. [<a href="/papers/20.onward.semsemver-submission.pdf">pdf</a>]</li>
<li> OOPSLA submission under double-blind review with Jun Zhao and David Liang.</li>
</ul>

We had a change of submissions between OOPSLA and ICSME and then punted the ICSME
to be a NIER submission as deadlines approached and results didn't.

Splitting the work with David on our OOPSLA submission, I ended up
writing a bunch of code to extend Jun's code. There was an intense
week of work before the OOPSLA deadline, culminating in two crunch
days. Anywhere on Earth time is actually reasonable in NZ (midnight
AoE = midnight NZ time or something). After I finish reviewing other
peoples' OOPSLA submissions I'll go and clean up my own code.

It was fun to work on the semantic versioning essay with VUW colleagues. I hope
to continue joint work over my extended stay here in Wellington and beyond.
I've never written a research essay before but took inspiration from
the form of <a href="https://yanniss.github.io/">Yannis Smaragdakis</a>'s Onward
essay this year,
"<a href="https://yanniss.github.io/next-paradigm-onward19.pdf">Next-Paradigm Programming Languages: What Will They Look Like and What Changes Will They Bring?</a>" Also,
maybe one of these years I can pull off a longer visit to Athens; COVID prevented
this year's visit.
The submission process for the Onward essay wasn't nearly as intense as for
OOPSLA, partly because we weren't collecting results at the last minute.
It did involve some late nights at a hut though (more later).

We continue to collect results for the ICSME NIER paper. They were looking
a bit thin but after revising the approach they are more promising now.

Out of my initial pile of 10 OOPSLA papers I've reviewed 2 so far. The 
remaining reviews will be a chunk of work for the next week.

This month I did 26 days of work. Five of these work days were just talking
to people. (I mean, that's the whole prof job, talking to people, right?)
I'm ready for a more normal balance now.

## Ongoing (my grad students)

I missed the group chat due to the Queen's Birthday weekend this week.
But planning one for tomorrow. 16 days with grad student meetings last month.
Basically I try to reserve some days where I don't have grad student meetings.

## Collegiality

Last month I wrote "not that much". This month: that much! Read through
300 OOPSLA abstracts, sent bids, reviewed two papers. Talked to ECE Chair
Selection Committee. Prepared a print-on-demand book
(via Blurb) of <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~drayside/">Derek Rayside</a>'s
writings to Software Engineering students in these interesting times.

Sent my final life tip to SE 2024:
* don't get between a seal and the water.

I guess I should collect the SE2024 survey results and send them off
for analysis.

# Travels

* Walking distance: 122.8km (down from 192.5km last month, 6 zero days this month)
* Biking distance: 25.7km (2 judo practices)
* Trips: 2

## Walks
* <a href="https://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/enjoy-the-outdoors/parks-and-reserves/town-belt-reserves/te-ahumairangi-hill">Te Ahumairangi Hill</a>
* Brooklyn Wind Turbine to <a href="https://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/enjoy-the-outdoors/walks-and-walkways/beyond-the-city/red-rocks-coastal-walk">Red Rocks Coastal Walk</a>
* <a href="https://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/enjoy-the-outdoors/walks-and-walkways/beyond-the-city/johnston-hill-loop">Johnston Hill loop</a>
* <a href="https://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/enjoy-the-outdoors/walks-and-walkways/beyond-the-city/te-ara-papararangi">Te Ara Paparārangi</a>
* couple of walks at Zealandia and Botanical Garden

The highest-walking day in May was only 10.5km; we didn't do any long walks,
mostly due to being busier. Red Rocks was a bit long, but not compared to April.
Some of the zero days were due to paper deadlines.
Others were due to weather or due to being travel days for climbing.
Tramps planned for June.

<a
href="https://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/enjoy-the-outdoors/walks-and-walkways/top-20-welly-walks">Top
20 Welly Walks</a> progress: 14 done, plus parts of three others. The long one remaining
is Skyline. I also am planning to do Sea to Sanctuary even if it's not one of the top 20.
But first, <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/wellington-kapiti/places/matiu-somes-island/">Matiu/Somes Island</a> next week. Weather looks good.

## Trips
Fortunately, Elliott recruited me on two climbing trips once we were
well-ensconced in Level 2.

* looked for a climb at Tongariro; trad/sport climbing at Ruahepu; sport at Tukino
* Queen's Birthday weekend: took the ferry to South Island and climbed at [Charleston](https://patricklam.ca/post/20200910-charleston/).

I was originally thinking that I wouldn't be able to do any trips until the ICSME
paper deadline but once we punted that then I was free(r) to go climbing at Ruapehu.
I was worried about the Ruapehu trip being irresponsible&mdash;not because of COVID
but because of the day job&mdash;but we couldn't have hit the ICSME deadline.

### Ruapehu

After staying in a castle-shaped hotel in Palmerston North, we proceeded to
Tongariro in search of the classic climb Cioch. MP didn't think she'd ever be at
the Tongariro Alpine Crossing again, but there we were. We found the climb
but didn't have enough time.

We had another good day of climbing at <a
href="https://climbnz.org.nz/nz/ni/tongariro/mt-ruapehu/whakapapa/whakapapa-gorge">Whakapapa
Gorge</a> ("generally immaculate rock" ✓) although it might have been
better to get more than 4 routes in. Scoopage is a classic though. At
Double Cone I had climbed some alpine trad but this was the first trad
cragging I'd done in a while.

And Elliott wanted to explore Tukino (Mangatoetoenui Gorge, "remote
rugged character"), which was on the other side of Ruapehu.  Also good
rock. Got in a bunch of sport climbs, although Bowie Rickman slabs
seemed easier than advertised. We got out just before the torrential downpour. Go us!

The nights at the Manawatu Lodge (awesome facility with the needed
WiFi) were filled with paper revisions and OOPSLA bids. Made it hard
to start as early as desirable given 9hr days.

### Charleston

On this trip I went somewhere new for once, which was super exciting,
even if it involved 2 days of travel for 1 day of climbing. The Interislander
ferry is a completely normal ferry. Cathedral
Wall is full-value.  I aimed for Wild Horses in the Sun and did the
crux, but probably went off route to Stinger for the rest of it (more
protectable). Dolphins. Gotta get back to the West Coast.

# Groceries & other bills

OK, now we have restaurant expenditures. May was pretty normal and our grocery spend
was C$770, which is probably on the high side compared to Canada. We still aren't
spending that much on restaurant. Let's see how June goes.

<style>
    th:nth-child(2),th:nth-child(4) {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>

|month | C$ | month | C$ |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| May 2020 grocery | 770 |
| May 2020 restaurant | 477 | 
| April 2020 grocery | 1000 | April 2019 grocery | 372 to 600 |
| April 2020 restaurant | 0 | April 2019 restaurant | 750 |
| March 2020 grocery | 900 | March 2019 grocery | 600 to 900 |
| March 2020 restaurant | 550 | March 2019 restaurant | 720 |

I also compared electricity bills again. I now think the price per kWh is
about the same as Ontario if you take the total amount and divide by kWhs.
Monthly spend in May was $232 on 896kWh, up from $217 in April
(but it is also colder in May). Our electricity provider doesn't
do off-peak pricing but it has an Hour of Power where you get "free"
power. It's harder to take advantage of the Hour of Power when you have to spend money to heat the place
all day.

# Conclusion

Wow. Almost back to normal. Got a bunch of papers submitted, now reviewing OOPSLA
and hoping for ICSME. More trips in the future.
