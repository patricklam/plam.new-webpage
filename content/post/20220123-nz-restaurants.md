# Wellington

When we landed in Wellington, the Uber driver said that if we liked restaurants, we'd love
Wellington, with its high restaurant-per-capita count. It turns out that we don't love most
NZ restaurants (MP: "savory foods shouldn't be sweet!") but there are a couple we quite like.

* [Satay Palace](https://www.sataypalace.co.nz/): first restaurant we went to in NZ. Pretty good but somehow we didn't get there often at all. Good noodles.

In the remainder, sometimes I put the place I liked most first.

## Kelburn

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Takeout from Upesh Kitchen.</figcaption>
</figure>

* [Upesh Kitchen](https://upeshkitchen.co.nz/): Nothing like a good curry/noodles after a lockdown. Also other times.
* [Yellow Chilli Indian Restaurant](https://www.yellowchilliindian.co.nz/): Decent choice for Indian food in Kelburn.
* [Brezelmania](https://www.brezel.co.nz/): Source of pies and other bakery items near home.
* [Cable Top Eatery](https://cabletop.co.nz): Quite good fish n chips right next to our place. Much better than the other Kelburn fish and chips option.
* [Milk and Honey](http://www.milkandhoneycafe.co.nz/): Canonical on-campus restaurant; white-people food not bad, but I don't recommend anything that tries to be Asian. (Also went to [The Lab](https://www.thelabfnb.co.nz/the-lab-university), [NAM D](https://www.facebook.com/restaurant.nam/), and coffee at [Vic Books](https://www.vicbooks.co.nz/cafe)).
* [Rātā Cafe](https://www.visitzealandia.com/R%C4%81t%C4%81) at Zealandia: I think I underrate this place, but every time I eat something here it's good.

## Central Wellington

Asian:
* [Mr. Go's](https://www.mrgos.co.nz/): We'd walked by many times but never actually tried it until March 2021 (so many missed opportunities). It's good pan-Asian cuisine. The decor is non-fancy. Fried rice is MP's favourite.
* [Dumpling'd](https://dumplingd.co.nz/): what it says on the tin.
* [Monsoon Poon](https://www.monsoonpoon.co.nz/): Asian fusion. I think there was a Bangkok Street Noodles which was worthwhile.
* [Seoul Salon](https://www.seoulsalonnz.com/): been here twice; once for a Wellington on a Plate burger. Would go more often but somehow don't make it to Korean food that much.
* [Siem Reap](https://siemreap.co.nz/): fancy Cambodian decor, good exemplar of the genre, should have gone more often.
* [K&K Food Caravan](https://www.facebook.com/cambodianstreetfood/), Wellington: had great Cambodian noodles.

Chinese:
* [Dragons](https://www.wellingtondragons.co.nz/blank): favourite place for dim sum, aka yum cha.
* [Regal](https://www.regalchinesewellington.com/) is not as good as [Dragons](https://www.wellingtondragons.co.nz/).
* [Orange Chinese](https://www.harboursidemarket.co.nz/stalls/orange-chinese-food-truck/) at Harbourside Market is open again, though in a different corner (the vendors are now more spread out). Usually quite a lineup but we went once when it was windy and there was no lineup.
* [Taste of Home](https://www.facebook.com/atasteofchina17/): I'd heard about this place and we finally managed to get some food from there (the hours are challenging). Lives up to its reputation. Here's a [glowing review](https://neatplaces.co.nz/places/wellington/eat-drink/taste-of-home). Chinese street food.

Vietnamese:

* [NAM D](https://www.facebook.com/restaurant.nam/): I like the banh mi here. Several small locations around Wellington, including a relatively new one at VUW.
* [Fisherman’s Plate](https://www.facebook.com/Fishermans-plate-wellington-393175621238990/): best pho in Wellington; also does generic burgers etc, but why would you do that.
* [Go Vietnam](https://www.govietnam.co.nz/): "chef's special duck pho" (chicken stock with duck).
* [Restaurant 88](https://www.restaurant88.co.nz/): More fancy than others. Haven't had Ga Con Chien before. Liked it.
* [Mekong Café](https://www.mekongcafewellington.com/): snacked here while waiting for our food to be made at Taste of Home. Goi cuon not as good as my grandma's. Not packed tightly enough.

Japanese:
I think there's a supply chain issue. Salmon is everywhere. Tuna sometimes. Other fish quite hard to find.
* [Tatsushi](https://www.tatsushi.co.nz/): not bad.
* [Ozeki](https://www.ozeki.co.nz/): bit further from the centre.
* [Yoshi Sushi](https://www.yoshi.co.nz/): better than I would have thought.
* [Kazu](https://www.fpcnz.co.nz/our-restaurants/): a bunch of different Japanese restaurants in Wellington, including kaiten (on Cuba) and izakaya.
* [Hey Ramen](https://www.facebook.com/HeyRamen/) in the Majestic Centre is decent.

Bakery-ish and miscellaneous:
* [Best Ugly Bagels](https://www.bestugly.co.nz/): St-Viateur and Fairmount fans may complain, but these are fully acceptable Montreal-style bagels 8000 miles away.
* [Pickle & Pie](https://www.pickleandpie.co.nz/): confounded my expectations for pies with a $10 pie (which came with a pickle, of course). Probably worth $10, but still.
* [Martha's Pantry](https://marthaspantry.co.nz/): we especially liked the savory part of the high tea, which ends up being quite substantial.
* [Mt Vic Chippery](https://www.thechippery.co.nz/), Wellington: good fish, extremely generous serving of fries: had leftovers which I put in the oven and ate at home with mayo, yum.
* [Zelati Dessert Cafe](https://www.zelati.com/dessert-cafe): proper milkshakes (most milkshakes in NZ have flavour squirts, like slushies; they actually make milkshakes from ice cream).
* [Le Moulin](https://www.facebook.com/lemoulinbakerynz): you can get croutons there; they are surprisingly hard to acquire in NZ except in pre-made salads. Croissant wasn't as flaky as I'd hoped.
* [Concorde Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/lemoulinbakerynz): a last-minute discovery (literally just before getting on the flight out of NZ), good bakery right in the middle of Lambton Quay in Wellington.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">High tea at Martha's Pantry.</figcaption>
</figure>

Italian:
* [Ombra](https://ombra.co.nz/): Italian restaurant, pretty good, but we don't go out to Italian restaurants much.
* [1154 Pasteria](https://www.1154.co.nz/): super central location; walked past it so many times; finally had pasta there, worth going to if you want quick pasta.

Other white people food:
* [La Cloche](https://www.lacloche.co.nz/): somehow always busy at lunchtime even weekdays in Kaiwharawhara. Legit French food: bakery but also more meal-type foods.
* [Logan Brown](https://www.loganbrown.co.nz/): we did the @home version during Level 3 (which was fancy & delicious); meant to go either here or to Bellamy's, but never quite made it.
* [Shepherd](https://www.shepherdrestaurant.co.nz/): meets expectations for brunch
* Ti Kouka Cafe: RIP; was fairly famous Wellington brunch spot and deserved its reputation

Not white people food:
* I liked my hangi croquettes at [Karaka Cafe](https://karakacafe.co.nz), had a smoky taste. But I always like croquettes.


## Newtown and further

Both Newtown and Petone have a concentration of good restaurants. Let's start with Newtown.

* [The Ramen Shop](https://theramenshop.co.nz/): best ramen in NZ?
* [Café Laz](https://www.cafelaz.co.nz/): I often have Turkish food while travelling in New Zealand. Iskender isn't really iskender. But I'll have lamb on fries. Here was better than most.
* [Chan's Eatery](https://www.facebook.com/ChansEatery/): more good Chinese food, including roast duck with noodles
* [Bebemos](https://bebemos.co.nz/): had a Feijoiada here

Brooklyn:
* [Jo's Pies](https://www.facebook.com/Jos-Pies-649718925080699/) (Brooklyn): not as fancy as Pickle & Pie but way more substantial than I expected.
* [Salty Pidgin](http://saltypidgin.nz/): quite good; had good whitebait and greenlip mussels here. I'd had a whitebait sandwich elsewhere before and that wasn't so flavourful, but this was. Also ox tongue.

Further out in Wellington:

* [Oikos](https://www.oikos.co.nz/): near the airport but easily accessible by the #2 bus; packed on a Wednesday night, deservedly so. Greek food in Wellington is available from them and from a food truck; Oikos is more upscale. I always enjoy pastitsio. Tzatziki was extra garlicky.

* [Greta Point Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/Greta-Point-Cafe-177203312326008/), Hataitai: location is sweet as, on the water


## Hutt Valley
* [Nora Kebab](https://norakebab.co.nz) in Upper Hutt, highly-reviewed on Google Maps and tasty mix iskender. Also good decor.
* [Vietnamese Restaurant and Cafe](https://www.vietnameserestaurantandcafe.co.nz/) in Petone: not very inspired name but correct Vietnamese food
* [Dumpling World](https://www.facebook.com/dumplingworldrestaurant/) in Petone: exceeded expectations for Wellington, but generally what I expect for a Chinese restaurant. Dumplings (pork & Chinese chive with chili oil) were great, of course. Also many other dishes, including Hofun noodles and pork ribs.

## Markets

* [Harbourside Market](http://www.harboursidemarket.co.nz/): greens, plus good quantity of food vendors.
* [Paraparaumu Beach Saturday Market](https://www.facebook.com/paraparaumubeachmarket/): cute hipster stuff plus some greens.
* the late [Victoria St market](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100057680250126): mostly green-grocer focussed, but their site got condo-fied.
* [Carterton Farmers' Market](http://www.cartertonmarket.co.nz/) was quite modest. Bought some fruit.

## Breweries and bars

No individual comments. Wellington has a lot of choice.
* [Heyday Beer Co](https://www.heydaybeer.com/)
* [Southern Cross](https://thesoutherncross.co.nz/)
* [Garage Project](https://garageproject.co.nz/)
* [Rogue & Vagabond](https://www.rogueandvagabond.co.nz/)
* [Fork & Brewer](https://forkandbrewer.co.nz/beer/)
* [Choice Bros](https://www.choicebros.co.nz/): don't come here for the poutine
* [One Fat Bird](https://onefatbird.co.nz/)
* [The Occasional Brewer](https://theoccasionalbrewer.co.nz/)
* [Thistle Inn](https://www.thistleinn.co.nz/)
* [Lulu Bar](https://www.lulubar.co.nz/)
* [Library Bar](https://www.thelibrary.co.nz/)
* [The Arborist Rooftop Bar](https://www.thearborist.co.nz/)

## Greater Wellington

* [The Tin Hut](http://tinhut.co.nz/) (Featherston): good pub-type food; tripadvisor review from 2016 said it was closed, but I've definitely been there more recently.
* Kiss and Bake Up (Otaki): semi-fancy bakery
* [Entice Café and Catering](https://entice.co.nz/), Masterton: a quite good museum cafe, I had eggs benedict. We double ordered a hot chocolate and they refunded us. Thanks!
* [Scoops Icecream Parlour & Café](https://www.scoops.co.nz/), Masterton: we got there the last day before they were selling to new owners; looks like a community hub for Masterton. 

## Not really Wellington

Feilding:
* [Hansens Cafe](https://www.hansenscafeandstore.co.nz/) promises "seriously good sausage rolls" on the sign outside and lives up to those expectations.
* [The Strong Room](http://www.thestrongroom.co.nz/) in downtown Feilding: ravioli is pleasant after a short hike, salad even more so.

New Plymouth:

* [Area 41](https://www.area41.co.nz/): We were off to climb Taranaki and stayed in New Plymouth. This Italian place was decent.

# Rotorua/Waikato

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20220123-nz-restaurants/pie">}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">How it all started: Patrick's Pie in Rotorua.</figcaption>
</figure>

* [Patrick's Pies Gold Star Bakery](https://www.facebook.com/GoldStarPatricksPies/): the reason I visited NZ; after more than a year, I finally made it there. That other Patrick Lam definitely deserves to win awards for his pies. Will go back.
* [Saigon 60s](https://www.saigon60s.co.nz): light dinner at a reasonably authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Rotorua.
* [Abracadabra Cafe](https://www.abracadabracafe.com/): good risotto.
* [Hobbiton mid-winter feast](https://www.hobbitontours.com/en/experiences/evening-banquet-tour/) (link is to the evening banquet tour, which is similar but not identical): I mean, we didn't go specifically for the feast, but it was highly competent too. Hobbiton is really well done as well.
* [THE BAKER](https://facebook.com/thebakertirau/) in Tirau: has great Google reviews. As I recall, the eclair was first-class, the almond croissant decent. The pie was good too, although not as superlative as Patrick's Pies. Also Tirau has a bunch of corrugated iron art.
* Kebab and Pizza in Putururu: I said I went to a lot of Turkish restaurants, didn't I? Good enough that we went there twice. Not as good as Café Laz. The lamb is good. I found the chicken not as tasty as it could be.
* [And Rice](https://bestjapaneseinrotorua.business.site/) in Rotorua: I think I had the ramen? Again, good but not superlative. The Ramen Shop in Wellington can be superlative. Would go again. Curious to see how they do their onigiri. I used to have grocery store onigiri before judo practice in Switzerland.

# Auckland
* [BBQ Noodles House](https://www.bbqnoodleshouse.com/) in Albany: definitely Cantonese; tasty noodles
* [Huai Yang A Noodle Less Ordinary](https://www.huaiyang.co.nz/) in Mount Eden: more tasty noodles; also more modern than BBQ Noodles House
* [Ken Yakitori](http://www.kenyakitori.co.nz/) in central Auckland: Free cabbage! Sauce extra. Also, pretty similar to the yakitori place we wandered into in Tokyo once, except that I could understand what I was ordering.
* [Red Earth Bistro](https://redearthbistro.co.nz/), Papakura: getting back late (in NZ terms) from the Firth of Thames we were happy to see this place was still open
* [Hallertau Brewery](https://hallertau.co.nz/): biergarten with good food; I think I had the krokets.
* [Sal's New York Pizza](https://www.sals.co.nz/): It's a chain. I went to a location in Albany. OK but not great. I had one slice of pizza (and some other food) the day before weigh-in and was pretty light.

# Northland

* [Fat Camel](http://fatcamelcafe.co.nz/): prominent restaurant with well-executed Israeli food in Whangarei
* [Green's Russell](https://orderatgreensrussell.co.nz/): Thai or Indian (take your pick) in Russell


# Top of the South

* [Harakeke Restaurant](https://www.awaroalodge.co.nz/dining-at-awaroa) at Awaroa Lodge & Cafe: We were there on opening day for the 2021-2022 season. The staff were quite enthusiastic about being open and the food was fantastic, especially for a place that's really in the middle of nowhere. (One might additionally hope that they could be on the water, but they're not). MP had a salad, which was nice on a multiday hike.
* [Picton Village Bakkerij](https://www.facebook.com/PictonVillageBakery/): off the ferry and to the pie shop
* [O'Sha](https://www.oshathaieatery.com/menu), Takaka: we went here in July 2020 and discovered that they had recently opened; good Takaka option.

Kaikoura:
* [Why Not Cafe](https://www.whynotcafekaikoura.com/), Kaikoura: Kaikoura has fewer good eating options than I would hope. This place was recommended by the bus driver and lived up to its recommendation.


# Christchurch/Canterbury

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20220123-nz-restaurants/kinji">}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Proper sushi at Kinji.</figcaption>
</figure>

* [Kinji](https://kinjirestaurant.com/): Best sushi in NZ that we've had yet; we went twice in one trip, and then every time we can on subsequent trips!
* [Smokey T's](https://www.smokeytsbbq.com/): 4.9⭐ on Google, superlative BBQ
* [Costas Taverna](https://costastaverna.co.nz/): Was great to have a meze platter here.
* [Le Panier](http://www.panier.co.nz/): Best croissants I've had for a while!
* [KUMO](https://www.kumo-cuisine.co.nz/): Not bad for kaiten sushi.
* [Riverside Market](https://riverside.nz/): More of a (non-chain) food court than a market, but has diverse options.
* [Original Sin](https://www.originalsin.co.nz/): Italian, and good oysters
* [Commi](https://commi.co.nz/): I had bánh xèo, yellow Vietnamese crepes. The texture wasn't quite right but it was tasty.

Canterbury and out to Mount Cook:

* [Blue Lake Eatery & Bar](https://bluelake.kiwi/): Amazing French food by an expat pastry chef. We tragically had no room for dessert!
* [Geraldine Farmshop & Cafe](https://geraldinefarmshop.co.nz/mobile/menus.html): Well, they have quite the bouncy castle outside, but I can't say that much about their food. I did get some produce though.
* [Last Post](https://www.facebook.com/thelastpostoamaru/), Oamaru: MP had wanted bangers and mash for a while
* [Oamaru Farmers' Market](https://www.oamarufarmersmarket.co.nz/): luckily we arrived in Oamaru on Sunday when they were open and also could watch the steampunk cosplayers.
* [Whitestone Cheese Factory Outlet](https://www.whitestonecheese.com/pages/our-factory): well worth buying cheese from this Oamaru outlet.
* [Mount Cook Alpine Salmon](https://alpinesalmon.co.nz/): Lake Pukaki views and e.g. salmon sashimi.

# West Coast

* [Betsey Jane](https://betseyjanenz.business.site/), Fox Glacier: Exceeded expectations. Everything was just tasty. They did mussels right (not universally true here), fish and chips and pasta were both great. It being a pandemic, the place was deserted the first time we were there on a Saturday night (2 parties including us), but on the Monday there was a reasonable crowd.
* [Sevenpenny](https://sevenpenny.co.nz/), Greymouth: Had a whitebait sandwich here. Has potential.

# Queenstown/Wanaka

Went to Wanaka a few times.
* [Big Fig](https://www.bigfig.co.nz/), Wanaka: counter service of non-fast-food.
* [Kika](https://kika.nz/), Wanaka: had good seared tuna. The cabbage dish was a bit weird: it had okonomiyaki toppings on a big head of cabbage.
* [Burrito Craft](https://www.burritocraft.co.nz/) had tasty tacos. I got the fish, beef, and pork.
* [Aki Sushi](https://aki-sushi-wanaka.business.site/) had properly vinegary rice in their chirashi sushi. Also things that were not salmon. A win.
* I overheard that [Little Cup of Happy](https://little-cup-of-happy.otgshop.co.nz/) had recently opened. Worth visiting for your flat white needs.
The last three places there were in a food truck lot.

We didn't spend much time in Queenstown, but we went to a few places.
* [Fergburger](https://fergburger.com/), Queenstown: super famous; no lines on Dec 2 2020. (It had lines just before Christmas!) Excellent burger.
* [The Lodge Bar](https://www.roddandgunn.com/us), Queenstown: Had a game pie, which was actually a NZ pie (not quite a hand pie). Tasty.
* Queenstown patio dining at [Pedro's By the Lake](https://www.pedrosbythelake.co.nz/) while waiting for COVID test results. The issue with staying in a closet of a hotel room is that it's hard to hang out in the room. It was marginally OK for having class at least.


# Southland/Fiordland

* [Bao Now](https://www.facebook.com/baonowbyhabitfoods/), Te Anau: excellent bao, poutine (-ish, with cottage cheese), dumplings; Te Anau staples.
* [South Sea Hotel](http://www.southseahotel.co.nz/), Oban (Stewart Island/Rakiura): They have a monopoly in the winter but their daily specials are excellent. Also their Quiz Night is famous. We took 3rd.
* [Fat Duck](https://www.thefatduck.co.nz/menu), Te Anau: more upscale, maybe go here after finishing your Great Walk and showering.
* [Fat Bastard Pies](https://www.fatbastardpies.co.nz/), Invercargill: Walked by, had a pie, enjoyed.
* [Tuatara Cafe/Bar](https://tuataralodge.co.nz/cafe/), Invercargill: Chill place to chill while we were waiting to go back to Te Anau.
* [Tui Base Camp](https://tuibasecamp.co.nz/), Tuatapere: OK but not the best ribs I've had; MP liked the comfort food she ordered (seafood chowder).

And also:
* [Dost Turkish Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/Dost-Turkish-Cafe-1575221209396731/), Dunedin: Iskender with spicy sauce was indeed spicy.
* not a restaurant, but I got a good loaf at Harvey St Merchant in Waitati on our way to Silverpeaks. Was good when I remembered I could have it with margarine. Cheese would have been even better.
