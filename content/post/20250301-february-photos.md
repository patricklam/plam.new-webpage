February is a few days shorter than January, but I processed half as many photos in February as I did in January! Two more sets in February than January (9 versus 7), but most of the sets were small,
and there were way fewer big sets.

So, that's 9 sets off the queue and 10 sets onto the queue, but those 10 sets contain 3,085 pictures. That'll be fun.

# Around the Mountain Circuit (January 2023)

After we got back from the South Island, we had scheduled the [Around the Mountain Circuit](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/taranaki/places/egmont-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/around-the-mountain-circuit/) around Taranaki. As opposed to the [Round the Mountain Track](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/central-north-island/places/tongariro-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/round-the-mountain-track/) around Ruapehu. I flew back to Canada the day after finishing the AMC.
