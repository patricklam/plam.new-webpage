I've been busy with being in Canada (you'll hear about that in a few
weeks) and posting about the travels, but I've been wanting to write
about November as well. I'll put my overall thoughts about urbanism in
Montreal, Quebec City, and Kitchener in next month's post.

# Situation

I'm very much not thrilled with being in Canada as Omicron looms. But
I guess I am not ready to quit my job yet. New Zealand is far better
placed to deal with Omicron, since its border to even Australia is
still closed until mid-January at least (subject to review!), and they
have the luxury of possibly waiting until a bit closer to winter to deploy
boosters (though that might be a bit too much of a gamble).

Good move, me, for not signing up Netherlands workshop.  Had it
happened, it would have been a disaster. Except that it went
online. (More below).

I said that MIQ was not protecting Auckland last month. The Auckland border is now
open, but MIQ is protecting NZ from Omicron, and vaccines plus summer is reducing the NZ delta 
numbers quite effectively.

Having said that, people in NZ complained about the vaccine rollout being
slow, but I often talk to people in Canada whose second doses were just 2-3 months
before mine. NZ is not that slow, especially when there weren't that many cases
in the community (outside of Auckland).

The numbers in New Zealand (mostly Auckland) are definitely staying
well below 100 per day now on most days, while Quebec and Ontario numbers are now rising steeply. 
Vaccination plus non-pharmaceutical interventions really do
work. I said delta was too hard last month, but it's only too hard for NPIs alone, not
for summer plus NPIs plus vaccines.

The strange thing is that Quebec actually seems to have more stringent
measures than Ontario with vaccine passes for instance. But still
about twice as much COVID per capita.  One would think that it has to be private
events. Also, Ontario is reporting 30% Omicron and Quebec much less. I
haven't been able to understand on what evidence Quebec is reporting
that. They're aware that it's coming but their position is that it's
not yet there. Can I beat it with this weekend's judo training camp,
or should I opt out? [Update: opted out; update 2: it got postponed.]

In all of Quebec, Ontario, and New Zealand, it's now impossible to dine 
in a restaurant while unvaccinated. Quebec is pretty good with checking ID.
I haven't tried Ontario or New Zealand (under the new rules) yet.

## Vaccinations

I got my second dose on November 1. I think that was mostly a good idea to optimize immunity,
but if I had gotten it earlier (could have been late September), then I'd now almost be eligible
for a booster dose. That wasn't at all on the radar back then, though. One can only make decisions
with the information available at the time.

As of December 14, NZ's vaccination rate among 12+ is significantly higher than
Canada's: fully vaccinated in NZ is 89.8% and Canada is 86.7%, or rather, 
10.2% unvaxxed in NZ and 13.3% in Canada, so 30% higher. Canada's still doing
better on total population, which must be a combination of 5-11s and the population
distribution. NZ fully vaccinated as a percent of total population is 75% and Canada 76%.

Both New Zealand and Canada have started booster shots. New Zealand
has a 6 month rule, while Canadian provinces have different rules
(here we go again). The number of boosters in New Zealand is still
fairly tiny, at 174k (plus 25k third primary), while Canada has
administered 3M third doses. That's about 2.5 times as many, per capita.

The overall NZ vaccination rate is quite slow now, at about 10k per day plus 10k boosters, but there really aren't that many people 
left to vaccinate. Take Auckland. Reported population in the Auckland District Health Board is 424k (there are two
other DHBs) and 402k are fully vaccinated, for a rate of 95%. Capital and Coast (Wellington) is at 94%.
Northland is the lowest, at 81%, which is why it is staying at the "red" traffic light while the
rest of NZ moves to "orange".

By ethnicity, the Asian rate is reported as greater than 990 of 1000; European/Other at 897; Pacific peoples at 871; and Maori at 759.
So the gap is below 20 percent now. (NZers would say "European/Other on 897" but I find that weird).

# Professional

This month was quieter than October, since we weren't pushing for any
specific deadlines. I talked to my students on 7 days. Just general
progress on projects, and post-submission consolidation. I did submit
an application for a Desire2Learn educational grant which got
rejected, and worked on my NSERC Alliance proposal (still not done).

I gave a talk at SPG about our SANER submission.

I thought about going to [BENEVOL](https://benevol2021.github.io/) in the Netherlands but I looked at the COVID numbers
and they didn't look like they would be good going forward. Closer to the date, they indeed weren't good, and the workshop went virtual. I guess I could have submitted
after all. But again, I can't engage with virtual workshops or conferences.

In terms of teaching, I helped norming design document marking. We had TAs grade the design documents
and project demos.

Had lunch/social events with colleagues on 9 occasions. November was busy!

In total I had 18 days of work (22 working days). The no-work-day
count was 13, including a bunch of travel-to-Canada days.

Goals for December: review PLDI papers, work on NSERC Alliance, work on SE retrospective,
prepare for teaching in January (with new/old COVID curveball).

## Collegiality

There's the usual reviewing load. PLDI reviewing opened just before I left (8 papers) but it's really a December task.
I reviewed another grant proposal (strong reject) and I have an NSERC proposal to review.

I did some freelance student advising (not my graduate students): as usual, some SIGPLAN-M, as well as
an unusually large number of alumni (3), both my graduate alumni and SE undergrad alumni. 

Finally, I started on the Nominations/Elections committee for our
Faculty Association. (The General Meeting in December was bonkers.)

# Travels

* 🚶 Walking distance: 165.6km (a small walk at a time)
* 🚲 Biking distance: 71.1km
* 🚗 Driving distance: 871km (Mount Cook again)
* 🚗 Taxi distance: 48.8km (WLG x3, YUL)
* 🚌 Bus distance: 74.6km
* 🛩 Plane distance: 15910km (WLG-TIU, TIU-WLG, WLG-AKL, AKL-LAX, LAX-YUL)
* &#x1F6A1; Cable car distance: 2.8km (4x)

We had one last trip before I left New Zealand. I'd been thinking of this for a while and I'm glad I got to execute it.

* flew into Timaru (only one more South Island Air New Zealand station I haven't been to, Blenheim)
* drove to Oamaru, visited the Sunday market, [Steampunk HQ](https://www.steampunkoamaru.co.nz/) and Sunday cosplayers, and the [blue penguin colony](https://www.penguins.co.nz/) (I think I liked the Dunedin [penguins and albatrosses](https://albatross.org.nz/) more)
* visited the [Vanished World Centre](https://vanishedworld.co.nz/) (fossils) in Duntroon, the boulders at [Elephant Rocks](https://www.thecrag.com/en/climbing/new-zealand/south-canterbury/area/11872165) (some of which I tried to climb), and the [Takiroa Maori Rock Drawings](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/takiroa-rock-art-shelter)
* did not go [glacier iceberg kayaking](http://www.mtcook.com/glacier-sea-kayaking) because there were too many icebergs
* mellow multipitch at [Sebastopol Bluffs](https://climbnz.org.nz/nz/si/aoraki/tasman-river/sebastopol-bluffs)

Northstar Motel in Oamaru had an excellent price/value ratio.

## Walks

Nothing major, but did manage to accumulate decent kms anyway.

* [Tasman Glacier Lake](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/aoraki-mount-cook-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/blue-lakes-and-tasman-glacier-walks/) Jetty
* [Waikanae Estuary](https://www.doc.govt.nz/waikanae-estuary)
* various walks around Wellington
* [Mount Victoria](https://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/outdoors/walks-and-walkways/across-the-city/mount-victoria-loop) twice
* AKL to [David Lange Park](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/parks-recreation/Pages/park-details.aspx?Location=361) to [Mangere Mountain](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/parks-recreation/get-outdoors/aklpaths/Pages/path-detail.aspx?ItemId=398) to AKL

## Other sports

Despite a busy social calendar, I only missed one judo practice in
November before leaving, for 7 workouts. Better than I have been able
to maintain in Canada in December. And I managed to get to climbing gyms 4 times,
which is pretty good. Though Grand River Rocks is better than Fergs
and pretty much as easy to get to. GRR is
also free to me since I bought a life membership, thus providing
incentive to go.

We climbed 4 pitches at Sebastopol Bluffs: Red Arete ("the South
Island's best 13 [5.7]") and the first pitch of Mako. I figured that
some moderate multipitch was just what I needed after a year of
flailing on NZ rock.

## Travel planning

NZ kind of shuts down over Christmas. I helped MP plan a trip to Kaikoura
involving swimming with dolphins and a solo overnight hike on a private track.
Should be good.

I'm hoping to fight and referee at the Manitoba Open in mid-January. Let's see
if that gets canned (so many things have, sadly).

I cobbled together a plan for December which I've of course had to adjust due to COVID.
My friends offered me 3 places to stay, so I really have nothing to complain about.
But it is a bit tiresome for my stuff to be all over the place. Turns out it's not in
quite as many places as I thought, and I now have a working bicycle. I can almost live like
a normal person.

There was also packing my stuff for the return to Canada. We'll see how much stuff 
I'll need to bring back to NZ when I go back.

## Purchases

* Christmas gifts
* some NZ bird book (more books, just what I need to transport)
* 12mm Samyang lens (pretty wide angle!) and lens wrap (dealing with lenses is more stuff to faff about with)
* brake pads for my bike (brakes are really important!)

## Book

* [The Water Dancer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43982054-the-water-dancer) by Ta-Nehisi Coates; Virginia 
(and Philadelphia) in the slavery era felt extremely remote from New Zealand in 2021. Coates does a good job of telling
the story of a Black man who gets his freedom and works with the Underground Railroad.
Of course, colonialism was/is a thing everywhere, but US plantations didn't have any exact equivalent in New Zealand.
I'd heard of the Underground Railroad but not any details of how it worked.

I also skimmed _Shorebirds of New Zealand_ and _How to Photograph Absolutely Everything_.

## Restaurants

In Wellington: 
* Le Moulin: you can get croutons there; they are surprisingly hard to acquire in NZ except in pre-made salads. Croissant wasn't as flaky as I'd hoped.
* Concorde: a last-minute discovery, good bakery right in the middle of Lambton Quay in Wellington 
* 1154 Pasteria: walked past it so many times; finally had pasta there, worth going to if you want quick pasta
* Arborist: rooftop bar
* Shepherd: brunch spot; meets expectations for brunch
* Vietnamese Restaurant and Cafe (Petone): not very inspired name but correct Vietnamese food
* Kazu: acceptable kaiten (conveyor-belt) sushi

Also:
* Timaru: Last Post: MP had wanted bangers and mash for a while
* Oamaru: Sunday market, Whitestone Cheese Factory Outlet: cheese is well worth buying

## AGMs

* Wellington Judo Academy: an organization that is thriving despite COVID challenges, unlike many Canadian judo clubs I follow
* Zealandia: informative session on how this big organization is doing in the midst of a leadership transfer

# Conclusion

That was a rewarding last month in New Zealand. It's a shame that I had to leave just before summer, but I hope to be back
as soon as possible. December is even more unstable than usual, since I'm technically homeless, but I'll manage just fine.
