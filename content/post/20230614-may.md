This post is super late. I had to write the [West Coast Adventures
Trip Report](/post/20230612-west-coast-adventures), which took a
while, and then I was in Gold Coast for the Australian judo nationals
(which were a pleasure to referee).

May wasn't a hugely successful month, though the travelling was great
fun.  I got the message that there were some things to work on for
refereeing, though I had to decipher what the message was. I think I
need to project more calm. Also, we got an ICSE submission rejected.
That'll go in again in September. FSE, I think.

# COVID

Nothing really happened this month. I dodged it on my travels. Indoor
spaces are all over the place with respect to ventilation, and
probably those spaces with 500ppm CO<sub>2</sub> are really safe (but
what's the risk/reward for maskless grocery shopping?) Again more
incremental advances in science; I saw some more work showing that
metformin and vaccines are helpful to avoid Long COVID.

# Professional

My main professional task this month was preparing the PNW PLSE talk
(started slides 6 days before). Maybe I'll properly OBS record it one of
these days, now that I have a bit more free time.

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20230508-april/pnw-plse" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Keynote talk at PNW PLSE. <a href="/img/20230508-april/plam-pnw-plse-23-slides.pdf">[slides]</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Worked on 18 days (pretty high for so much travel); nominally 22 work days in May.

## Grad students/mentees

In theory I only have 1 active student this term, but we are finishing
Moh's EMSE revision too. And I met up with future student Alex in
Montreal at the Pub Burgundy Lion. It's nice to be able to do that.  I
met up with one academic sibling, one ex-student whose PhD committee I
was on, one ex-SE student, talked to SIGPLAN-M mentees 3 times, and
current/recent past students 4 times.

## Research

The PNW PLSE keynote/UBC talk went well, I think. Not super deep (keynotes
shouldn't be?); kind of entertaining, I hope.  I really should prepare
it for publication. But first, I worked on EMSE revisions in both May
and June; they're pretty much done now. I also wrote up the training
plan and DEI sections for my upcoming Discovery Grant renewal.

## Teaching

I finalized the marks from Spring on May 3. That's it for teaching until 2025!

## Collegiality

Not that much. SIGPLAN-M mentoring: met with a new mentee; now they
are doing peer mentoring as well. Rejected ECE FYDP
consultant requests; I'll be on sabbatical next Winter. Did run a class prof
hour, talking about which ATEs to take. Had a FAUW meeting.

# Trips

There was the huge West Coast Trip, plus Canadian nationals.

* [Trip Report: West Coast Adventures: Thanks friends!](/post/20230612-west-coast-adventures)
* Canadian Judo Nationals

Then I went to New Zealand. All this ate almost all of my month of May.

Read the trip report for more about the West Coast Adventures. The
tl;dr is that I hadn't really been to see my friends out West since
before COVID, so I arranged to go to the Eastern Sierras (ski
touring); Seattle; Vancouver (and climbing at Squamish); and Nelson
BC. Arranging weekends versus weekdays was a challenge, since I had to
visit some places on weekends and others on weekdays.

</figure>

## Travel planning

On-the-fly changes for my Vancouver car rental (maybe it wasn't worth
it in the end because the new, cheaper rental had a 30 minute wait to
get a car). Gold Coast/Brisbane travel planning (pretty minimal, just
needed an airbnb for the night after nationals; everything else was
arranged for us.)

# Movement statistics

Lots of driving, some human-powered transport. It's hard to get those
miles in when constantly travelling, even if you try to mix it up like
I do. (But see below on elevation gain). Anyway, May definitely was
not a normal month.

* ðŸš¶ Walking: 92km on 20 days
* ðŸš² Biking: 84km on 7 days
* ðŸš— Driving: 2389km on 20 days (lots of driving on my West Coast trip)
* â›· Skiing: 37km on 5 days (earned all turns, i.e. no chairlift)
* ðŸšŒ Bus: 175km on 8 days
* ðŸš— Taxi: 50km (SEA, YZZ, YUL)
* ðŸš‡ MÃ©tro: 70km on 4 days
* ðŸš† LRT: 19.5km on 2 days
* âœˆ  Plane: 27,960km (YYZ-YVR, SFO-YVR, SEA-YVR-YCG, YZZ-YVR, YVR-YYZ, YYZ-YUL, YUL-YOW-YVR-BNE-WLG)
* &#x1F6A1; Cable car: 0.6km (1Ã—)

## Walks and Ski Tours

Elevation gain: 20,600' (6300m)

All of these ski tours and the CBC Tower walk were on the West Coast Adventures.

* Mammoth Rock Bowl, 3.2km, 1500'
* Mount Wood, 11.6km, 7800'
* Devil's Slide 1, 3.8km, 1800'
* Devil's Slide 2, 3.2km, 1200'
* Paradise Glacier (Rainier), 15km, 4688'
* [CBC Tower (Nelson)](https://westkootenayhiking.ca/the-cbc-tower/), 14km, 3600'

## Sports

One visit to a climbing gym (Allez Up), wished I had the better shoes;
one judo practice. (Also tried to stop by Seattle Judo Dojo but they
weren't open when I did). Lots of outdoors time and a bunch of time
inside a shiai-jo.

# Pictures

Again quite productive in processing photos. As I write this in
mid-June, I've finished the photos from the West Coast adventures and
only have the few photos from the Canadian Nationals trip in May, so
making net progress.  Should finish Japan and the remaining 2021
photos next. Here are the pictures I processed in May:

* [Book review: We the Others](/post/20230531-we-the-others)

# Miscellaneous

Home repair: had to get a furnace filter on my way through Waterloo,
which contributed to having to change to a later flight (arrived about 3 minutes
after the 45 minute baggage dropoff deadline).

## Acquisitions
* [Blizzard Zero G 85 skis 22/23](https://www.blizzard-tecnica.com/global/en/skis/men/touring/zero-g-085-flat) and skins: so light
* [Dynafit Superlite 175 binding](https://www.dynafit.com/superlite-175-binding-z10-08-0000048776?c=516577&number=08-0000048776_0000000002&listing=1)
* [Blizzard Zero G Peak Carbon boots](https://www.blizzard-tecnica.com/cz/en/zero-g-peak): 990g
* [BD Recon Bluetooth Avalanche Beacon](https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/product/bd-recon-bt-beacon/): not obsolete, but was recalled & fixed
* [Black Diamond Mission Approach Shoes](https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/product/mission-lt-ms-approach-shoes/?colorid=6224): different colour than the ones I've had 3 times, but supposedly the same.
* NZ power cable for laptop.

We did go ebike shopping in Wellington, with a purchase of an ebike
for MP in June. Brought my really old ski jacket in for zipper
replacement: better to do it now when I don't need it than a week
before I need it.

## Restaurants

West Coast:
* [Amigos Grill Portola Valley](https://m.facebook.com/pages/Amigos-Grill/113744218659410): Cal-mex, hard to get outside the US.
* [Burgers Restaurant](https://www.burgersrestaurant.com/): one of the only options on a shoulder season Tuesday afternoon in Mammoth Lakes; had a bison burger
* [June Lake Brewing](https://www.junelakebrewing.com/) and [June Pie Pizza](https://junelakepizza.com/): great aprÃ¨s-ski
* [Dos Alas](https://www.dosalascafe.com/): endless shrimp escabiche, well-seasoned
* [Ohanas 365](https://www.ohanas395.com/): Hawai'ian plate lunch from a truck, yum
* [Savory Pies of the World](https://www.savorypiesoftheworld.com/): not quite a NZ-style pie but worthy Russian Beef Strogonoff pie
* [Chelo Kitchen + Eatery](https://www.cheloyvr.com/): way more flavour than Kisa (Wellington)
* [Banh Mi Saigon](https://www.banhmisaigon.ca/): pretty big
* [Kozak Ukrainian Eatery](https://www.kozakeatery.ca/): had already eaten but got an eclair. "Fuck Putin" says the sticker
* Taqueria Juarez: food truck near Marcus's place
* [Shultzy's Bar & Grill](https://www.shultzys.com/): cheese hot dog after PNW PLSE
* [CafÃ© Paloma](https://cafepaloma.com/): good Mediterranean food, had eggplant parm
* [Grillbird](https://www.grillbird.com/): salmon teriyaki with Hawaia'an macaroni salad again
* [Kokanee Glacier Resort Restaurant](https://kokaneeglacierresort.com/restaurant/): excellent laksa (and other pan-Asian foods); run by a friend of My Tram's
* [Marzano Nelson](https://www.marzanonelson.com/): well-executed Italian food
* [Gina's Gelato](https://ginasgelato.com/): good community feel
* [Bridge View CafÃ©, Trail](https://www.facebook.com/thebridgeviewcafetrail/): another community hangout for digital nomads and old men

Did not cook much on the trip. The scale knows.

Montreal:
* [Toujours Mikes](https://toujoursmikes.ca/): wouldn't normally write about it, but here we are. Had a lobster guÃ©dille, surprisingly reasonable.
* [Plaza Antique](https://plazapmg.com/en/plaza-antique/): The Canadian Nationals banquet was here. There was also a wedding. Also reasonable I guess. We had more people than they expected.
* [Pub Burgundy Lion](https://www.burgundylion.com/): got the fish and chips I expected; interestingly, this pub was cited in [We, the Others](/post/20230531-we-the-others/) over a TripAdvisor sticker being bilingual. Hard to find a place that was open on the JournÃ©e nationale des Patriotes (aka Victoria Day).
* [White Heron Coffee (Griffintown)](https://whiteheroncoffee.ca/): pretty good tea

I checked out some places in Wellington I was hoping to eat
at. Grace Patisserie is closed for maternity leave and the Chook Wagon
seems to have been replaced by a salad place.

A special mention, though, to the new Ethiopean food option at the
Harbourside Market in Wellington. Yum! Seemed in line with the best
Ethiopean restaurants I've been at in other places.

## Volunteering

Refereeing at Canadian nationals, bunch of OAC work (including system
administration for web servers). Attended a Wellington Judo Academy
Quarterly General Meeting.

## Books

Finished and reviewed _Before the Dawn_. Started, finished, and reviewed _We, the Others_. See this month's
[posts](#may-posts) for reviews of both of these.

I did really have to finish _Before the Dawn_ before leaving the country, so that I could return it to the library. That
was a slog. _We, the Others_ was a much lighter read, at least in terms of words, if not content.

# Conclusion

Things should now be much more quiet for a while, settling down in New
Zealand and plugging away at work and getting away when I can.
