The point of the early May judo camp was to prepare for Nationals, which was two weeks later
in Montréal. I wanted to fight in the seniors (i.e. all-ages) so that I could grade
for 5th dan in the Competitive Stream&mdash;I'm 2 wins short. Judo Québec staff asked
if I wanted to also fight in the veterans (i.e. old man) division. Sure, why not.
The veterans was on Friday and the lightest category is -66kg. Seniors was on Sunday and
I was confident that I could make -60kg. I've never missed it before when trying, but it's not
super fun.

But first, because of the timing, I was able to wish my mom happy birthday. Surprise! 
(I didn't tell them that I was coming.) She was happy to see me.

# Veterans Open Nationals

In veterans, we reproduced the podium from 2018, except that we got an
additional bronze medallist.  Couldn't beat the gold medallist Arthur;
he did the same throws on me as on the silver medallist Tim.  And I
lost to Tim after 5 minutes of overtime. I had one win on the ground
with a pin. I'd hoped that being able to train during the pandemic
would have helped, but apparently it didn't.

# Seniors

What I really cared about was seniors, because only senior points
count for Competitive Stream grading.  First round was against the
silver medallist from U18, who also had a good showing recently this
year in seniors. We got to overtime but then he threw me. Overtime is
going to be tough to win against 16 year olds.

I won the next match (in the repechage). I didn't technically win on
the ground, but I had a pin for a half-point (he escaped) and then he
panicked and went in for a throw which I countered for a full point.

My opponent no-showed the next match, which I really didn't want (no points). That's the rules, 
I guess, but really not ideal.

The next match would guarantee 5th place. Unfortunately I lost to the
same guy I'd lost to at Quebec provincials; he finished 3rd on the
day. That left me with a 7th place finish. The match was going well
(better than at provincials) until he figured out how to outgrip me.
Then it didn't go well for me, and I got thrown. I've noticed this
happening in the past too. Sometimes one can figure out the thing that
works against an opponent. Unfortunately I wasn't the one doing the
figuring in this match.

# Conclusions

People say it's inspirational that I'm still fighting at my age
(yes, I'm 44 and fighting 16 year olds). I'm lucky in that I can make the
time to train, in that I was in NZ during the pandemic, and that I have
no significant injuries. In the end, competition
is about evaluating your current skill level compared to your field, and one's
goal&mdashmy goal&mdash;is to win, not just to participate.

So, overall, I found that it was a good return to senior competition. My most recent
senior Canadian circuit points before that were at the nationals in 2016, and
I felt like I did better at this event than in 2016. It was
about as well as I thought I could do. Obviously I'd like to do better,
but also, it is the Nationals. Thanks to my coaches: Bianca (Québec
provincial coach) and Cédric (club coach). Now I have to fight the Québec Open
and possibly the Ontario Open (hope not).

# Bonus: Travel logistics

Originally, weigh-in on Thursday was scheduled for 6:30pm, and I'd gotten a flight arriving at 4:30.
Trudeau airport to tournament site could be done by taxi in 20 minutes if no traffic (but, Montreal at 4:30).
Then Judo Canada changed the weigh-in time to 5:30. Definitely too tight. 

Fun travel facts: Air Canada's Rapidair flights (Toronto/Montreal/Ottawa) allow [free standby](https://www.aircanada.com/hk/en/aco/home/book/routes-and-partners/express-service.html#/) for any non-Basic fare. Usually I do manage to standby successfully if it's not too close to takeoff time. But I got a bit worried because this was Thursday just before the Victoria Day long weekend. I figured that I'd better try to fly as early as possible to ensure success. One lecture recording and one 8:50 departure from Waterloo later, I managed to get confirmed on the noon flight from Pearson. (Note 1: in principle it's standby for free/confirmed for a fee, but I've been confirmed on the flight for free occasionally before too; Note 2: I'm 2/2 for confirming from Pearson even though I'm booked from City Centre). This got me in to Montréal Trudeau at 1:30 and to the Centre Claude Robillard at 3:15pm using the 747 city bus. No point in getting there earlier.

On the way back (Monday) I also managed to standby for Trudeau-to-Pearson despite booking to City Centre again. Got me back to Toronto 30 minutes earlier than I booked, and not having to take UP Express was another 30 minutes to an hour saved. Might have gotten home at 10pm on the booked itinerary; actually got home at 9pm.

Other annoying logistics: we had to stay in the tournament hotel the
nights before we were fighting, but it was kind of pricey ($150) and I
didn't really want to share a room especially in the time of COVID, so
I swapped between airbnbs ($50) and the tournament hotels. As I've
[written before](/post/20211226-urban-living-part-ii-montreal/), the
things I need to get to in Montreal are not super accessible to each
other. Bikeshare on a 30°C day helped for losing weight and also for getting around,
but I also used the metro a bunch. Also annoying was that I didn't necessarily
want to leave my laptop around the tournament site unattended more than I needed to. 
So I stashed stuff in different places which also weren't that close to each other.
I thought about not bringing the laptop but didn't think I could get away with that
on a 5 day trip in the middle of the term. In the end, it was just annoying, but
not too bad. I say that because my laptop didn't get stolen...
