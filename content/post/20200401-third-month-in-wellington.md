My notes say that I bought tickets to Athens on March 1. As if things
would be normal in two months.  The first nine days of March, which I
wrote about last time, did seem completely normal.  Then we went to
Queenstown/Wanaka and Taranaki. As we were at Taranaki, things quickly
became not normal. The last 11 days have been a whirlwind, and only
in the past few days have I been able to get some research done.

Flights to YYZ and ATH in early May are definitely not happening. In
early March I wrote: "Hope the global situation is stable by then."
Not so much.

Last time I was talking about an extra 3 days in NZ. Now it's an extra
6 months.  We didn't make it to Melbourne as planned, although it
turns out we didn't need to do a visa run either.

New Zealand is a good place to be for now, especially since we have no
place to stay in Ontario. We're planning to stay until October. Winter
is coming: days are under 12 hours now, although it's not usually
cold.

# Professional

Pushing words around for VUW project. No code since last time; but we
probably have most of the code that we need for our current
implementation target. Sharpening the organization of the essay that
we'll submit. Talking about a bunch of ideas for future projects.

Giving a short talk tomorrow, recycled from one I gave at UC Berkeley.
It'll be my first Zoom talk, so I tried the setup today. We'll see how
that goes.

Out of 22 days since the last report, I did work (broadly defined) on
8 of the days.  We did a bunch of planned travel in the middle of the
month, but then life maintenance (namely moving) really took over the
rest of the month. It's only been since April 1 (NZDT) that I've been able
to work on the paper.

## Ongoing (my grad students)

Now that all this has happened I've started weekly meetings with all of my
grad students at once, as well as weekly-or-better one-on-ones. We tried the first
one on Google Hangouts but it turns out that Zoom is much better. In one case
we have continued infrastructure development. Other students have had
exciting (planned) life developments which have been keeping them busy.

## Collegiality, i.e. "eat-your-vegetables"

Reviewed ECE 459 final and re-reviewed one journal submission. (I told them to
stop sending overdue reminders given everything that's going on). I have one more
journal paper to review.

Sent weekly tips to SE 2024 and exhorted them to fill out the SE
survey.

Nope. Worked on Taranaki pics but there's a lot of triage left.

There were still lots of French and German people (and one Spanish
person) at Taranaki in mid-March. Surely some of them are still here
in NZ.

## Climbing

Multipitch at Double Cone, George 14 220m (5.7 6p). Climbing reasonable. Descent challenging. Trip report to come. 15 hours car-to-car.

## Judo

Well, I was going to judo until everything shut down. Now I'm not.
Ankle continues to heal, it's easier to stand on one foot now than in December.

## Visitors

Our visitors left Australia just in time and are finishing their self-isolation around now.

# Conclusion

Yikes. Hanging in there.
