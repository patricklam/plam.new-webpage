Sabbaticals are a large block of unscheduled time.  Time always
passes. Have I done stuff in my time in Wellington so far?

# Professional

I've started a number of collaborations with colleagues in Wellington,
and am thinking of a survey paper and an essay in particular. I'm excited
about contributing to these projects. I hope to have more to report
in my February update.

In other news I have a climbing-related submission to the Journal of
Outdoor Recreation and Tourism (sadly an Elsevier journal) which got a
revise-and-resubmit. Progress!

## Ongoing (my grad students)

I've been aiming to continue motivating my graduate students and am
talking to them once a week or more often. We made substantial progress
towards a test case analysis paper and targetting OOPSLA. That paper
has some data but no implementation of a technique yet; I was hoping for
ISSTA but that was premature. We've had some success with screen sharing
via <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a>.

I also clicked on the "recommend admission" button for a number of
prospective grad students. I hope they come! I need to also find
funding for them.

## Collegiality, i.e. "eat-your-vegetables"

I probably spent about 20 hours this month on these service tasks.
They are important in the sense that the system needs people to
do these tasks, but they are also quite unrewarding.

* Reviewed 2 NSERC Discovery Grants
* Test-ran ECE 459 assignment providing feasibility feedback
* Pinch-hit undergrad advising in a special case

Oh, and of course there's this whole new website relaunch! That took
some heaps of time (um, I think I'm doing NZ lingo incorrectly) but
is an improvement over the past.

# Travels

No planes in January since arriving on January 1 (though I walked to
PPQ airport). Travel limited to: trains, boats, cars, buses, bicycle,
and foot. I have walked 180km in the four weeks I've been here, many
times up this hill to where I'm staying. Every time I go downtown it
is 120m of elevation gain, so that's probably 2000m of gain total,
which is not bad for daily living. I also somehow have failed to make
it to the climbing gym, although I am going on a climbing trip to Wanaka
tomorrow.

Also did some photography, but I guess I've only uploaded one set of pictures
from a Rangiwahia tramp: https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1211

We got a rather inexpensive superzoom camera. Of course it doesn't take as
good pictures as the compact camera, but it has a lot more zoom. Different
tools for different purposes (e.g. taking pictures of birds).

## Markets

* Victoria St: mostly green-grocer focussed
* Harbourside: greens plus some food vendors
* Paraparaumu: cute hipster stuff plus some greens

There is an avocado glut this year. I've seen prices to
80c/avocado. Also been to the Wellington Night Market but that's
prepared-food, and the Pasifika Fest (chop suey on rice).

## Walks

* Southern Walkway, 1.5 times (19km including walking there, 800')
* Putangirua Pinnacles (8km, 1500')
* Cape Palliser seals, 2 times, and lighthouse
* Kapiti Island: Trig to Wilkinson (4.6km, 1500')
* buying a broken bicycle in Paraparaumu (14km)
* Patuna Chasm Walk (6km)
* Rangiwahia Hut (8.8km, 2000')
* some walks at Zealandia

Most birds: Kapiti Island and Zealandia

## Lord of the Rings

* Rivendell (Kaitoke Regional Park, Upper Hutt)
* Paths of the Dead (Purangirua Pinnacles)
* Hobbits' Hideaway (Mount Victoria)
* Gandalf statue at Wellington i-SITE
* Eagles at WLG airport

# Conclusion

I've always been wary of being too results-focussed because there is a lot of randomness
about results. I can say that I'm happy with the initiatives I've started so far, and
that I did manage to make progress this month, though a lot of it is still early. And
it's been a great time living in Wellington.
