Onwards to actual historic districts. Well, sometimes they had been destroyed and rebuilt to look historic (actually
the case with Magome from part I). Other times they
were legit historic buildings but moved to be in a village together even though tha wasn't historically accurate
(hi, [Hida Folk Village](https://www.hidanosato-tpo.jp/top.html)!)

# Day 3 part 2: Matsumoto, February 20

The 11:00 train got us to Matsumoto by 12:04. The distance from Nagiso
to Matsumoto is about 100km.  Turns out the car takes about 2 hours,
and includes 78km on 中山道/国道19号 i.e. the Nakasendo/Route 19 (now
in car road form I guess) and 15km on toll roads; I couldn't estimate
how much that costs, but the train costs ¥1820 without a rail
pass. Anyway, the route is in the mountains. Japanese Limited Express
trains (Shinano No. 7) go through the mountains fast enough.
Presumably cars have to take the twists on the Nakasendo more slowly.

## Castle

Matsumoto is still surrounded by mountains and contains Matsumoto Castle.
According to Wikipedia, that castle is one of Japan's "premier historic castles",
along with Himeji Castle, which we visited in 2005. The castle itself, though,
is in the plains. It's not immediately obvious to me what it protects.

The castle is 6 stories high and surrounded by a moat. Looks pretty
legit.  There are stairs that definitely don't meet code because of
their excessive height (up to 40cm steps, and 55 to 61° incline). Also
they come with signs "don't take pictures near the stairs". I wonder
how many people have fallen down the stairs.

From the castle we get a good view of the city and the surrounding mountains,
or clouds, as the case may be. It definitely comes with windows for use
in planning. Also for shooting things out of. Speaking of shooting, the castle
also comes with a lot of guns being exhibited, as well as castle construction
information.

There were some staff dressed up in historic costume. We didn't ask
them why they were doing it (presumably to give some historical
colour), but we did get some pictures.

The moat was a good place to photograph some waterfowl (gadwall, coot,
mute swan, eastern spot-billed duck) but the real star was the black
kite that was enjoying its lunch on top of the castle. I was looking
at the castle roof and noticed a bird and then also some flying
feathers.  The binoculars and the 100-400 showed more detail. And then
I ran over to the other side of the castle to avoid backlighting,
giving the picture we see here.

## Shrine and Frog Street

We also saw the [Yohashira-jinja
Shrine](https://www.go.tvm.ne.jp/~yohasira/) and Nawate-dōri. Google
says the shrine is a "small traditional religious shrine" but it's not
that
small. [Nawate-dōri](https://goingbattywithmatty.com/2021/12/26/frog-street-of-matsumoto/)
is the "frog street"; a webpage describes it as having a "subtle but
recurring frog theme". You can buy knick-knacks on that street; we
didn't find it that interesting, but the samurai frogs in battle
scultpure is something to see.

## Food

I had a tasty fish croquette for lunch and dinner at a sort of weird
restaurant. It was really cold but MP still wanted an ice cream
cone. Ordering at the dinner place was through the phone and the order
wasn't quite what we had meant to order (we got two of a dish that we
ordered one of; they didn't overcharge us, though). There were a bunch
of places in Matsumoto advertising horse meat, but I'd seen a news
article about the horse being exported live from Canada with perhaps
dodgy animal care standards and maybe that's not so good.

## Onwards

It was cold and we had seen all we had wanted to see in Matsumoto, so
we went to the restaurant early, and then took the 2hr highway bus to
Takayama. It was dark so we mostly missed the mountain views on the
bus.  I'm glad we weren't driving in the snow over the mounain
passes. The bus also stopped at some onsen and, I think, some
adventure destinations. There were just 3 of us on the bus. It's also
much more direct than any train routes, and cost ¥3500 per person.

The bus dropped us off at Takayama station, and we walked 1km in the snow
to our hotel, which featured fancy baths.

Bag shuttled from Nakatsugawa to Takayama successfully.
