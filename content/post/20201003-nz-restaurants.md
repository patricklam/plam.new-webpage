I consolidated the list of restaurants we liked in New Zealand from my monthly summaries so far. Considering how few days we spent in Christchurch there are a surprisingly large number of restaurants from there. In general we've been doing a lot of cooking a home.

# Wellington

* Upesh Kitchen: Our favourite Kelburn take-out place, Malaysian and South Indian
* Harbourside Market: Sunday market with food trucks
* Best Ugly Bagels: Montreal-style bagels
* Kazu Yakitori & Sake Bar: Good Japanese food, no chicken sushi on the menu
* Viva Mexico

* Ti Kouka Cafe: fairly famous Wellington brunch spot
* Fisherman’s Plate: best pho in Wellington
* Ramen Shop: was in NZ Herald list of restaurants, did not disappoint
* Dragons: famous dim sum (aka yum cha)
* Rātā Cafe, Zealandia: Had a bunch of good snacks here.
* Nam-D, Wellington: I like the banh mi at this food truck chain.

# Around Wellington
* Olde Beach Bakery, Waikanae Beach: pies!
* Kiss and Bake Up (Otaki): more pies! semi-fancy bakery
* The Tin Hut (Featherston): good pub-type food

# South Island
* O'Sha, Takaka: Enjoyable Thai food
* Why Not Cafe, Kaikoura: Recommended by bus driver, lived up to recommendation.
* Sevenpenny, Greymouth: Had a whitebait sandwich here. Has potential.
* Fat Bastard Pies, Invercargill: I liked the pies
* Bao Now, Te Anau: Bao, poutine (-ish, with cottage cheese), dumplings
* South Sea Hotel, Oban: They have a monopoly but their daily specials are excellent. Also their Quiz Night is famous. We took 3rd.

## Christchurch
* Costas Taverna, Christchurch: Was great to have a meze platter here.
* Le Panier, Christchurch: Best croissants I've had for a while!
* KUMO Japanese Cuisine, Christchurch: Not bad for kaiten sushi.
* Kinji, Christchurch: Best sushi in NZ that we've had yet; we went twice!
* Smokey T's, Christchurch: 4.9⭐ on Google, superlative BBQ
* Original Sin, Christchurch: Italian, and good oysters
