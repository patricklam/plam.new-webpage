Strangely enough, I am posting this on Quebec's Fête Nationale (June 24) and one month
after the hike itself.

# Monday, May 24: Mount French ⚜

I suspected that the Mount French route would be slightly marginal for
daylight, since it was posted at 6-7 hours and sunset is currently at
17:15. But I thought we could do it quickly enough. The weather
forecast was excellent and there were only a couple of fluffy white
clouds in the sky.

We left Greymouth at 9:05. No breakfast, no snacks, and a
decision to make: New World or Paroa Store?  The clock was ticking and
the New World would be a 5 minute detour (plus however much time we
spent in the store). Maybe Paroa Store would have adequate food.

Alas! It didn't really, but, well, I guess we didn't starve. The pork
belly pie needed salt (unprecedented for a pie). On the other hand, 
we got some salty snacks for the hike.

## On the route

With the pitstop, we managed to get to the trailhead at 9:55, and set
off at 10:10, leaving us 7 hours and 5 minutes until sunset. Posted
time to summit was 4 hours.

Inspired by the DOC staff person Steve at the Punakaiki Visitor Centre, I photographed
various fungi along the way; May is apparently peak season for
fruiting fungi. I didn't upload them to
[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) along the way, but I was
surprised to find that I actually could have once we ascended from the
valley floor. The cell towers on Mount French help with that.

The first two hours were relatively steep forest walking with not much
of a view. The trail is classified as a route, which is about
right. It's not a sidewalk, but it's also not Class 3. I guess 2+. We
hit treeline around 12:20 at around 1100m elevation.  (The thing about
this hike is that it starts at really low elevation, around 190m, and
it tops out at 1303m.) As promised by the promotional materials, we
had a great view of Lake Brunner (Moana) and the Southern Alps, which
do look like real snow-capped mountains at this time of year. Also
cellphone towers. Up higher, we could also see the West Coast and the
ocean.

Once we got past treeline, and especially once we got onto the ridge,
the wind really picked up.  It was no time to dally. At 13:25 (3.25
hours), we got to a place with some mysterious construction, some
towers, and looked like the summit. Beautiful views, well worth it on that day, and in good time to beat sunset.

## Missing the summit

Unfortunately, the GPS data suggests that we missed the true summit.  I
didn't see any point that was obviously higher, except for Ben
Claddagh, but the GPS says that we got to the marked structure, not
the summit. Ben Claddagh would have involved a couple hundred meters
of descent.  Without GPS, we would just have called it a summit, but
now I have to say that we probably didn't summit. Instead, we saw these weird constructions on the not-summit.

Getting back to treeline, we looked at the various plants. It would be good to know
New Zealand plants better. I can identify a few and look them up, but I definitely
don't know most of the plants. This [sub-gallery](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1337) has both fungi and plants.

Once we got out of the wind we had a lunch break and made it down the
mountain.  I did bash my knee falling at one point (it hurt for a week
afterwards), but otherwise our descent was uneventful, and we got back to the
car by 16:20, well ahead of sunset.

Driving to Arthur's Pass the moon was three days out from the full moon/eclipse on 
Wednesday evening; there was a good moonrise which is beyond my ability to photograph.
We got more views of snow on mountains as we drove through the pass during golden hour.

## Oops

In an ideal world, I would have fueled the car in Greymouth the night before.
But we were tired after a day full of tourist activities, so I put this off for later.
As we pulled into Arthur's Pass, the gas tank warning came on, and I knew that it was
about an hour (82km), to the next gas station. 

What's more, the gas station had a posted 17:00 closing time, and we
got to Arthur's Pass at 17:30. The pump was decidedly not automated,
but indicated that it was possible to call out the attendant for a
modest $30 additional fee. We spotted him still inside the building and got
him to turn on the gas pump.

Unfortunately, this rather old pump had bad UI design. I was noticing
that the dollar amount on the diesel side was going up. The attendant
then asked "Did you mean to put diesel in your car?" Well, at least he
didn't make us pay the call-out charge, just the actively-harmful diesel 
now in the car.

To be continued...
