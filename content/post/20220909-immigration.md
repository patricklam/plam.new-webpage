Thanks to my [parents'](/post/20160128-letter/) move to Canada (in 1971, as refugees from Vietnam, via France), my interactions with immigration authorities have been minimal throughout my life. I've had nonimmigrant status in the US for grad school and a sabbatical, and a Swiss work visa, as well as visitor visas that I had to apply for in advance for Vietnam, India, and China. All the other 32 countries I've visited were visa-on-arrival or no visa needed (e.g. technically Canadians usually don't have physical visas for the US, with some specific exemptions).

So, in terms of immigration bureaucracies I've interacted with most, New Zealand is by far #1.
