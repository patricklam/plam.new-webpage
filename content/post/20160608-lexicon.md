# Lexicon

Here are some academic terms that I've invented.
  
<ul>
    <li><em>Pre-batical.</em> A one-year postdoc taken straight out of one's PhD, after obtaining a tenure-track Assistant Professorship, but before starting said professorship.
      <br />
    <em>Usage.</em> Her pre-batical at UW turbocharged the start of her independent research career and let her branch out into that up-and-coming field.</li>
    <li><em>Associate professor purgatory.</em> The period a few years after returning from one's post-tenure sabbatical where one is no longer protected from service but still
      expected to constantly ramp up research productivity.<br />
    <em>Usage.</em> Joe's swamped with grant proposal writing and committee meetings in his associate professor purgatory.</li>
</ul>
