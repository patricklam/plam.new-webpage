summary:    "Didn't process nearly as many photos as in previous months, but got a few more sets in near the end of the month after travel was done."

These sets are certainly not uniform. The pictures-processed count was quite low until the last few days of October, since I was on the road for much of the month. In the end I still processed less than half as many pictures as I did in September, though more sets.

I removed 12 sets from the queue and added 11 sets, so definitely ahead, especially since the added sets should be easy.

[Picture

available. As always, pictures are clickable to go to the full gallery.

# Flash trip to Arizona (October 2024)

I had one full day and one half day in Arizona without other
obligations. I had no car and was in Flagstaff, so I chose to walk up
to the Mount Elden lookout, after going to the market. On this trip I
brought my a6600 with the 55-210, not too heavy, and much better photo
quality than the HX-90V.
