I thought that August had only 30 days, but that's September. Maybe I could have processed one more set.
Nevertheless, let's get this post out. I added 5 new unprocessed sets and removed 8 sets from the queue, so
I'm ahead in terms of sets here, which is better than [July](/post/20240801-july-photos)'s result.

[Picture
logs](https://www.github.com/patricklam/picture-processing-logs) still
available. As always, pictures are clickable to go to the full gallery.
