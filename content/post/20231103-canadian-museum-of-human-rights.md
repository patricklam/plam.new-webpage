Back in 2011 ([pics](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1196)), when I took the Canadian across Canada and got off the train for 4 hours in
Winnipeg, the Canadian Human Rights Museum / Musée pour les droits de
la personne was still under construction.

I found myself back in Winnipeg for 3 days in 2023 (to referee at the
Manitoba Open, which was great) and the museum is now open, so I went
for a visit after lunch at the Forks.  Human rights is an abstract
concept, so I was interested to see how the museum would represent
that in the form of exhibits.

The building is an imposing glass construction right near Winnipeg
Union Station, the Forks, St-Boniface, and pretty close to downtown
Winnipeg. The tower in the museum provides an impressive view of
Winnipeg.

In the shadow of the building is a tent encampment. It is visible from
the window near a quotation by and about Métis "road allowance
people", who lived on road allowances before the roads were built,
until being kicked out by the road eventually being built.

Anyway, the building is not a Frank Gehry building even if it kind of looks like one with
the weird angles. Antoine Predock is the architect. On a Friday in October
there weren't heaps of people and the air quality was as good as outdoors
in terms of CO<sub>2</sub>. I do wear a mask but really it would have been
pretty low-risk not to (but also low-benefit).

Aside from looking imposing, three features stood out to me. It has a
bunch of alabaster-clad ramps between levels. The Tower of Hope is a
tower inside a building which provides views of Winnipeg. And, the
Garden of Contemplation is indeed a serene corner of the museum right
in the middle.

# About exhibits

There was a private tour that I overheard a bit of at some point.  The
guide acknowledged that they really had to compress the stories to
fit. I felt that to be very true when they were talking about the
French Language Charter (aka Bill 101) in Quebec. There is a lot of
missing context that I know from growing up there, e.g. see Toula Drimonis's book
_We The Others_ ([my review](/post/20230531-we-the-others)). Any one of
these exhibits could be the subject of multiple PhD dissertations, but
of course the random museum-going public isn't going to be interested
in that, and that's not really the role of the public galleries of a museum.

# Indigenous content

There was an exhibit about [Treaty 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_3), which covers land not far from
Winnipeg, and postdates New Zealand's Treaty of Waitangi by 33
years. There are resemblances since it was negotiating with the
British Crown in both cases. But the First Nations are not the same as
the Māori and the natural resources are different.

Apart from that, there was other First Nations content worked into the museum
exhibits. Highly relevant, especially since First Nations are among the classes of people
in Canada with the most threats to basic human rights.

# Issues

Since it's all about me. There was a video segment with an interview
with a Vietnamese boat person. (My parents were refugees but left by
plane well before the fall of Saigon in 1975; the woman profiled in
the video left afterwards, when they were being harassed by the
Communist government). Normally, I read about historical Canada
things, and, well, these things are not something my ancestors were
involved with. This was different!

A lot of the issues that came up are far from resolved. There was a
bit about Israel/Palestine, which is very much in the news starting
with the attack by Hamas and continuing with the illegal collective
punishment by Israel. And there was an exhibit about the five
genocides recognized by Canada as of some date in the past, which
included the Ukrainian Holodomor. That is very much relevant today
with the Russian invasion. There was also an exhibit about that
invasion just at the very end.

The museum does profile some of those who have fought for human
rights. I'm not sure it really captures what it's like to be denied
one's rights, nor the sacrifices by people who are fighting for their
rights. But how much can a museum actually do that?  It can use
exhibits and perhaps audio and video. They had normal
everyday civilian clothing with bullet holes in it is, like, "oh,
that's not normal".

# Bilingualism

This is a national museum and thus should be bilingual. Was it?

I didn't interact with that many museum staff. The guy selling the
tickets spoke good enough French, though he at least had an accent,
and it's not really an in-depth conversation that you have when buying
a ticket. But, seems like they did manage to find people who can speak
French, from my limited experience. Certainly the displays are in
French.
