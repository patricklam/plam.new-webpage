In October I was working on my NSERC Discovery proposal, so I may have procrastinated sometimes by processing pictures. I selected about as many pictures as I did in July (887 versus 846), but the total number of pictures processed was 27% higher in July (3354 versus 2642). July did include a large collection of Estonian bird photos (710) and a walk up to Apostolidis (528). This month, on the other hand, I had lots of tiny sets, including in-transit days. Still, there were 13 over-100-picture days.

[Picture

available, and, as always, pictures are clickable to go to the full gallery.
