tl;dr: You can un-check-in luggage at your origin airport.

Sometimes I make things complicated for myself. Occasionally it works
out well.

After the Canadian Open Nationals in 2023, held in
Montreal, I was headed back to NZ with a bunch of gear, including
skis.

To maximize Air Canada (lifetime) miles, I'd booked
YUL-YVR-BNE-WLG&mdash;that is, Montreal to Vancouver to Brisbane to
Wellington, adding about 1600mi over the Auckland routing.  Air Canada
only offers seasonal service to Auckland, but May isn't the season (it is December through March).
So, the total scheduled distance for the Brisbane routing is 11207
miles, with a theoretical YUL-WLG being 9083mi and YUL-YVR-AKL-WLG
being 9636mi.

Here was my original itinerary:

|&emsp;|segment|time|
|---|---|---|
||YUL-YVR|dep 1810 arr 2025 |
||YVR-BNE|dep 2320 arr 0700<small>+2</small> |
||BNE-WLG|dep 0940<small>+2</small> arr 1510<small>+2</small>

I had requested an Air Canada eUpgrade, which costs a certain number
of eUpgrade points. Upgrading YVR-BNE is what costs most of the
points, and then the domestic segment costs very little more. But
upgrades are on a space-available basis, and it looked like there was
no space available on my YUL-YVR flight. Still, getting that segment upgraded
is more optimal than not.

Anyhow, I didn't really have anything to do in Montreal on that
Tuesday morning, and I was bogged down with heaps of luggage, so I got
to the airport by 1pm. Yes, I was at the airport 5 hours ahead of
time.  That was a $60 Uber ride from my parents' place, which I could
confirm by looking through my records. For some
reason, I have a picture from off the highway mid-trip. It's weird and
I have mostly forgotten about how that happened.

First thing to do at the airport is to check in all the luggage.

Then, I noticed a delay in the YUL-YVR flight, bringing estimated
arrival time to 2145.  The YVR connection was scheduled for just under
3 hours. The revised time would still have over 90 minutes for a
domestic-to-international connection, which is not too worrisome
if no further delays.  However, sometimes delayed flights
are then further delayed. I looked at the flight schedules and there
was availability:

|&emsp;|segment|time|
|---|---|---|
||YUL-YOW|dep <del>1600</del> 1620 arr <del>1646</del> 1703 |
||YOW-YVR|dep <del>1815</del> 1835 arr <del>2024</del> 2027 |

which was pretty much exactly my original arrival time at YVR. Plus,
these segments had plenty of upgrade space available. Though an upgrade
on the 45-minute YUL-YOW segment is not really that helpful.

<b>The whole point of this post is the shenanigans that become possible
under irregular operations.</b>

* One can ask the check-in agent for a different flight in the event of a delay and a connection. There is probably some discretion there. This agent and this delay were enough.
* <b>One can un-check-in luggage if there is enough time.</b>

The check-in agent called the baggage desk and got them to return my luggage to the carousel. I went and picked it up and then went back to the check-in desk to check it in for the new itinerary. (Presumably you can't do this 5 minutes before departure, but you can if it's in a few hours. Also if one isn't waiting in terribly long check-in lines. Status helps with being able to use the premium check-in line, which is usually&mdash;though not always&mdash;shorter.)

The rest of the flights were uneventful. I got upgrades on all of the
Air Canada segments (YUL-YOW, YOW-YVR, and YVR-BNE). There was time
for a quick snack at the Ottawa Maple Leaf Lounge.

Of course, I had more time at YVR and at the
Vancouver lounge.

The upgrade on YVR-BNE went through and I appreciated being able to lie down on the 14h45 flight.

I had just short of 3 hours in Brisbane and arrived
in Wellington after a long day of flights, with the final segment on Air New Zealand. (Which
I kind of prefer to Air Canada in some ways. But, loyalty programs strike again. And, it's not like
Air Canada flies Australia to New Zealand.)
