September was down again in terms of number of pictures processed, but
I was not at a computer for many days in September. (I wonder if I
could correlate the number of travel days with the number of pictures
processed). There are only 9GB of new pictures from September, so maybe
not adding too much to the backlog.  Desperately trying to have less
than a two-year picture backlog. Looking at the chronological order,
there are some big trips in the backlog, like New Caledonia in
November 2023 and the Travers Sabine in February 2024.  It is
challenging when there is a set of 400 pictures from a day.
