September was down again in terms of number of pictures processed, but
I was not at a computer for many days in September. (I wonder if I
could correlate the number of travel days with the number of pictures
processed). There are only 9G of new pictures from September, so maybe
not adding too much to the backlog.  Desperately trying to have less
than a two-year picture backlog. Looking at the chronological order,
there are some big trips in the backlog, like New Caledonia in
November 2023 and the Travers Sabine in February 2024.  It is
challenging when there is a set of 400 pictures from a day.

# Beaver Valley Climbing Festival/Ottawa/Montreal (August 2025)

* [Canadian Museum of History and merlin, August 6 (31/149)](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/2124)
* [Beaver Valley Climbing Festival, August 16/17 (73/417)](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/2130)

I thought I'd go to the BVCF, organized by the Ontario Alliance of Climbers. This caused me to get caught up
in the Air Canada strike, oh well. Surely it was worth it.
