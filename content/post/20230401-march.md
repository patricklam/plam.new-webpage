 Here I am in Laval. I took the GO bus from campus at 12:52, just missed the 2:00 bus to Pearson and caught the advertised 2:25 connection getting to Pearson at 2:50. I tried to talk them into letting me onto the 4:00 flight to Montreal, but I had booked the 5:20 flight from Toronto City Centre. Nah, I'd have to pay $113. It's not worth $113 to me. I get on the UP Express and get a delayed flight notification, and then another one. Also, the two previous YTZ-YUL flights had been cancelled today. I take the UP Express back to Pearson (the guy at Union said "yeah just don't tap anywhere") and say "hey, you're having a bad YTZ day, your flight is delayed 80 minutes" and they put me on the 5:00 plane to Montreal. (Then the OPUS machine at YUL is broken, but I buy a bus ticket at the metro.)
