Dear Ministers Chagger and Wilkinson,

I'm writing as a constituent to urge Canada to take action on climate
change. The recent release of the IPCC report highlights the necessity
of doing what we can to fix this human-caused problem. We need to take
action now as a society, and the government needs to take a leading
role: this problem requires collective action, and we as individuals
do not have the power to solve it on our own.

We're in a hole, with 1Â°C of warming already. The first thing we need
to do is to stop digging. Literally, in the case of the oil sands and
pipelines. The government has to get out of its ill-advised pipeline
purchases and arrange to leave hydrocarbons in the ground. The oil and
gas sector is Canada's leading cause of emissions and the government
ultimately has to shrink the size of this sector and provide
alternatives for workers.

In second place is the transport sector, including light trucks and
freight trucks. We desperately need better urban design to get people
out of their trucks in the city. Electric SUVs aren't going to save
us. We must require less driving to live everyday life, which also has
health and financial benefits also. Rail freight also has a role to
play here.

As ministers in the government which will presumably be re-elected,
you have the power to change the world in the most fundamental way
possible, keeping Canada and the world as a place that is habitable by
human beings. I am asking you to wield your power to save us.

Thank you for your attention, 

Patrick Lam, PhD, PEng
