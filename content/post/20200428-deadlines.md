This week's tip is kind of a meta-tip. When you want someone (possibly
yourself) to do something, set a deadline for it. Marketing experts
know this. This is why there are "limited time offers". People have
intentions of doing something. But if they can do it anytime,
sometimes they never do the thing.

The deadline for the survey is Wednesday, though I guess I could have
been more explicit about that.

Sometimes things are around for a while, although you never know how
long they'll continue to be there[1]. I've attached a picture of an
800 year old rimu in <a href="https://wellingtongardens.nz/our-gardens/otari-wiltons-bush/">Otari-Wilton's Bush</a>, where I went on my daily
walk a few days ago.

Stay healthy!

[1] In the absence of any other information, your best bet is that you are
at the midpoint of the interval, i.e. that the tree will be there for another 800
years.
