I should have pulled this into its own post as well, instead of incorporating it into the April report.
But I can cut and paste and re-edit it.

I'd noticed Air New Zealand's new Auckland-Hobart nonstop last year and booked it a few months ago.
Thus, originally, we weren't even supposed to have a stop in Melbourne! But, Air New Zealand (and many
other airlines) are short on planes, so they rebooked us through
Melbourne. I think we actually had two schedule changes, the last one
leaving us with almost all day in Melbourne (8am to 4pm).

I didn't appreciate the 6am departure. Specifically in our case,
because online checkin didn't work (because of the flight changes?),
we were supposed to get to the airport by 4:30am, and no Wellington bus
works for that. Biking to WLG with gear would have been difficult.

# Melbourne, April 28

On the other end, arrival in Melbourne was smooth, though we futzed a
bit with trying to re-check our luggage. The luggage needed to be
re-checked after Australian biosecurity and Qantas wouldn't take it
until 4 hours prior to take-off. So we were stuck with it all day,
which fortunately wasn't a big deal this time.

Alex came from Eltham to pick us up (and drop us off later). I hadn't
seen Alex and Nora for over a decade (since their wedding?); it was
nice to see them and to meet their daughter Elena. After breakfast in
the WLG lounge and second breakfast on the plane, we had brunch in
Eltham with bagels, pretzels, and cheese from the local farmer's
market, which was good.

Eventually, Teresa from Ottawa and visiting mathematician Fabien came by, and we went to [Warrandyte State
Park](https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/warrandyte-state-park)/Pound Bend for a little walk, which included views of the Yarra
River, a couple of birds, and a bunch of jumping kangaroos, which were
the first that we'd seen in the wild. From the park it was straight back
to the airport and then to Hobart.

Sometimes people say that airline status is overrated. It is more true
that in the US you can buy all of the benefits (for some price), and
less true in Canada. Anyway, the point is that we were at MEL and had
no status on Qantas.  Security moved fast. The plane was delayed. We
were hungry since we chose to not bring any food to Australia. Air NZ
lounges have pretty good food; on average, better than Maple Leaf
Lounges. We didn't have access to any lounges. One can pay for food,
and we did. Somehow the crispy pork banh mi looked good but was
not tasty. Sushi Jiro was OK. I wasn't keen to spend $6 on a small bag
of chips.

The airport bus in Hobart for two is about the same price as an Uber
(and the Melbourne one isn't cheap either, though cheaper than Uber).
We took the Uber to the [Mayfair Plaza](https://mayfairplaza.com.au/)
in Sandy Bay, which is a relatively posh neighbourhood near the
university. Then, we went to [Suminato](https://suminato.com.au/) (and
came back the next day!) and did a grocery run after supper. Australian
grocery stores aren't quite as extra as US grocery stores, but it feels like
they have more choice than NZ stores. I wonder if that's actually true.

# Hobart (MONA), April 29

After a tasty breakfast at [Daci and Daci](https://dacidaci.com.au/) (MP liked it so much that she went back got dessert
there for after dinner), we went to [MONA](https://mona.net.au/), which is a huge tourist
attraction for Tasmania.

## MONA
OK, what about MONA? Well, they run a fleet of MONA ROMA boats (fleet size 2) from
central Hobart to the museum, which is a neat way to get there. ("Sit
on sheep".) The formal entrance also involves climbing some stairs to
access the museum (though there is an accessible entrance as
well). There were indeed lots of people visiting the museum.

Overall, it's a pretty epic museum built into the Hobart rock. It's
just this place owned by this guy David Walsh who made some money
as an applied mathematician, er, professional gambler. There are some pieces
which are neat, but much of the art is somewhat weird or disturbing. I suppose
art is supposed to make you feel something. There's kind of nothing which is just
"oh, that's a pretty piece of art".

### Turrell Art Rides

My friend Chris strongly recommended that I see the James Turrell "art rides"
[Unseen Seen + Weight of Darkness](https://mona.net.au/stuff-to-do/unseen-seen) and
[Event Horizon](https://mona.net.au/stuff-to-do/event-horizon).

We went to Event Horizon first (though you get to it through the
Turrell Beside Myself tunnel, an appetizer). This is a room with no
visible borders; all of the surfaces are painted so that you don't see
anything about the room's configuration. You just see the half dozen
people there with you, and the exit, if you're facing that way. The
light colour slowly changes throughout your time there.

Then, we went to Unseen Seen, where you sit inside a ball and the light quickly changes colour.
You kind of see weird visual effects, but again, no shapes. Unseen Seen is paired with Weight of
Darkness, where you navigate to some chairs in a completely dark room for 15 minutes. MP really liked
that, despite misgivings about sensory deprivation chambers.

After the Turrell "art rides", we wandered around the museum and had lunch at Dubsy's, where a lot of
people did not like the not-burgers. We did not have a not-burger. The tagine was actually pretty good.

## Other Hobart Adventures

I was not thrilled that Mayfair Plaza doesn't store luggage unless
you're coming back, so we had to bring it to our next destination,
Hobart Tower Motel. That was a hassle for the next morning, with a
multi-stop Uber ride.

Also, we got a bunch of dehydrated food from [Strive
Food](https://strivefood.com.au/) which was pretty good.  It does
require using one's pot to reconstitute the food (rather than 
putting hot water into a bag), so a bit more stove time, but it's also
lighter. Still, I correctly guessed that a small gas cylinder would be enough.
They have a small storefront in Hobart, presumably with their "factory" behind the wall.

I also visited the judo club at the Clarence PCYC, who seemed to like having me visit. Apparently people from
Wellington had been there a few years ago to attend a clinic as well. I showed some techniques.

And, as I wrote above, we went to Suminato again (and got recognized as repeat customers).

# Launceston, April 30

The bus from Hobart to Launceston was reasonably but not completely full. No complaints about that
service. I always prefer trains, but Tasmania isn't that populated. There were three Sams on the
bus and staff got a bit confused when checking off passengers. Other people on the Overland had
delays flying into Launceston.

</figure>

We walked across town to [Sporties](https://sportieshotel.com.au/) ("A
Proper Sports Pub") and stayed in the rooms above the pub. Not posh,
but totally fine. Not noisy, in particular. But first, we had tasty Vietnamese food at Noodles N Rolls-tastic just off the bus.

After we got to the hotel (with another quick supermarket stop to get some more things we'd forgotten),
we went to the [Tamar Islands Wetlands](https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/tamar-island-wetlands-centre).
There was a tour bus which dropped off Asian toursts for a while, and then they left. New birds: Cape Barren Goose,
Pink-eared Duck, Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo, Forest Raven. Good bird site.

I tried to figure out the bus to Tamar Islands but I couldn't find any
reasonable way to pay for the bus.  I haven't carried cash for a while now
and the withdrawal fee was either $5 (at a white-label ATM) or $7.50
(at a bank ATM).  No thank you. I wonder what fee ANZ Australia would
have charged to withdraw from our ANZ NZ account, though I did not try
that. (Supposedly 0, from the ANZ webpage.)

MP thought that maybe we should have dinner at Sporties, but we instead went to
Alchemy. MP's bao and tacos were good. So was my chicken parm, though it was enormous,
and would also serve as breakfast.

# Next up: Onto the actual track

OK! in the next installment we'll start to write about the track itself.
