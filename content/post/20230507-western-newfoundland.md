I've wanted to ski at [Marble Mountain](https://skimarble.com) for a long time.
Easter weekend was coming up. I noticed that Marble tried to stay open until at least
Easter, and that Aeroplan redemptions to YDF were reasonable.

I got the ticket and then looked for a rental car, which I eventually
ended up getting in a bundle with a hotel for C$689 all-in (3 nights,
1 car). Not super cheap, but car rentals are kind of expensive these
days. My ski and food costs were really low, though.

# Day 1: Gros Morne National Park

* Gallery: [To YDF, and Baker's Brook Falls](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1680)

I stayed in Hamilton on Wednesday night (hi Gus!) and caught a
Thursday nonstop YYZ-YDF, departing at 8:35 and arriving at 12:45, so
there was enough time to see Gros Morne National Park that day. The
guy next to me on the plane (seat 24A is actually kind of cramped)
showed me iceberg pictures, but they were too far: I'd be up for at
least 4 hours of driving to get to Iceberg Alley.  St. John's is
better for that.

I figured that [Baker's Brook
Falls](https://bobsnewfoundland.com/bakers-brook-falls.html) in Gros
Morne would be an accessible hike. It was 16km for me. On the way in, I kept
my snowshoes on my pack. That mostly worked, but there was 200m that
was more sinky. I put on the snowshoes on the way out and that was
much easier. The road to the campground was too snowy to drive, so that added an
extra 7km of walking to the advertised 9km.

I actually brought significant gear with me in Newfoundland: skis,
snowshoes, and ice axe/crampons.  Didn't take the ice axe or crampons
out of the bag.

On the hike, I was also following tracks of two people and something
that looked like a dog. Turns out the animal was not travelling with
the French-from-France couple. Or rather, I chatted with the French
couple and saw no dog. Maybe it wasn't a dog. I was hoping to find
people to climb the Mountain with but they didn't look like a good bet
for that.

The falls themselves are scenic, with the snow adding an extra
touch. These are the more tiered type of falls rather than the long
drop. There are a couple of distinct falls.

The drive out to Corner Brook was about another hour from Gros Morne, with
stops at the East Arm lookout. At the hotel there was an analog [watchman's station](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/a4rc4x/i_found_an_old_watchmans_station_at_work_today/).

# Days 2 & 3: Skiing and snowboarding at Marble Mountain

* Gallery: [Corner Brook and Marble Mountain](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1678)

Marble Mountain has 225 acres and 1759' of vertical to Tremblant's 630
acres and 2116' of vertical, but it also has, I dunno, less than
one-tenth as many skiers. There was never a line for the (one) quad
lift. Maybe it's not so viable as a business (it's owned and
subsidized by the province), but it was great to be there.

It turns out that Marble Mountain tried switching to a noon-7pm
schedule this spring.  That makes a lot of sense to me, though I've
never seen any ski resort with that schedule.  In the winter there
isn't enough daylight, unless you're doing night skiing. But after
Daylight Savings Time you can definitely do it.  Staff said it was an
attempt to be available for people to get out to ski in the
evening. Marble Mountain is 10 minutes from Corner Brook, so that's
quite viable for the 32,000 residents of Corner Brook.

Captain Cook is famous in New Zealand. But I learned that he also spent
a few years mapping Newfoundland, before being deployed to the Pacific.
I visited the Captain Cook monument in Corner Brook and checked out some birds
at the Griffin Drive sewage outlet (warm water, I guess). Then I had a very average
poutine at the Marble Mountain lodge (lukewarm temperature).

The skiing on Friday was great. It started a bit slushy at the
beginning, but the temperatures got a bit colder and the snow
improved. There was lots of terrain that was interesting to me, namely
bumps and trees. I was back on my (ancient) Volkl 6* all-mountain
skis, rather than the beginner rentals I had in Japan, and gained
confidence in the skis' abilities through the day and was able to ski
more aggressively straight down the bumps.

After 5 hours of skiing, there was a wind stop for the lift. Some suckers were
stuck on that lift for an hour while that happened. By chance, I
wasn't.  At the bar, I chatted with a father and son from St. John's
who had stopped at Marble to ski before proceeding north to
snowmobile.

# Day 3: Oh no! Icey!

I planned a second day of skiing at Marble for the Saturday, after
getting lunch in town. I bought my $59+tax lift ticket, started skiing,
and noticed that everything interesting was closed due to ice. Oops.

I had the sunk cost of the lift ticket, and the groomed trails would
be really boring on skis, so I rented a snowboard for another
$40+tax. The groomed terrain was navigable, so it really was an
excellent day to practice snowboarding. Did the blue runs fine. Can
kind of fumble my way down black diamonds, but not competently (including
the last run, oops).

With the complete lack of people on Saturday, I didn't talk to anyone
on the chairlift.  Found some adventurers on Friday, though. Maybe I
have some people to go skiing with on future trips.

# Day 4: Pasadena, Gros Morne again, and back

I had booked a ticket out of Deer Lake at 17:20 so that I'd have time
on Sunday to do more Western Newfoundland things. It wouldn't have
been great for skiing, especially with the ice and the noon-7pm
schedule. OK, time to battle the FOMO. What could I do?

There were a bunch of hikes that I could potentially do in the park,
though yesterday's avalanche forecast&mdash;the last for the season&mdash;was
"considerable", so not so good for going into the wilderness. And e.g. the
Tablelands would be more of a drive and also under snow.

I finally decided to go snowshoeing at the Pasadena Ski & Nature Club. It was
a walk in the woods on my snowshoes. Didn't see that much, just trees and a few
birds. It was out of the wind, though, which was useful.

The Gros Morne Discovery Centre was closed. I walked to the treeline
on the Lookout Trail.  Probably should have used snowshoes to proceed
beyond treeline. Didn't quite manage to have lunch. Could've gotten something
at the airport, but didn't.

My flight back was via Montreal, where I had a 3h26 layover, and was
scheduled to arrive at Toronto at 22:56. MP was scheduled to arrive at
Toronto at 22:36. I short-checked my luggage to Montreal, picked it
up, and stood by/changed my flight to the 20:00 departure. That would have been
great, except that it was delayed and ended up arriving at 23:13. And
then Pearson did the Pearson thing and my luggage took 45 minutes to come
out. Thanks, Pearson. MP's luggage, from her United flight from
Houston, came out much faster, so she had to wait for me.

# Food

The best food in Corner Brook was at
[Sorrento](https://www.sorrentonl.com/): the seafood crepe was great.
Also good air quality (or not many people on a Saturday night). Also
had a worthy gyro donair from Louis Gee's, which was really busy at
9pm, and OK fish and chips from Da Marcus. The chicken salad croissant
from Harbour Grounds was pretty good; the hot chocolate was too sweet.
