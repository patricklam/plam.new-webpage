Kapiti Island is a nature reserve from which the New Zealand
Department of Conservation has removed non-native predators (possums,
rats, etc.)

Weka is not just a <a

toolkit</a>, but also a vulnerable flightless New Zealand bird. The
bird will steal your lunch that is right in front of you on the table
and run away with it if you don't chase after it.

Life tip: Don't be a weka. Cooperate generously with people. Good
collaborations go two ways: make sure that both parties get something
out of the collaboration.
