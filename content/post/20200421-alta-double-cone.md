On our <a href="https://patricklam.ca/post/20200212-climbing-in-wanaka/">previous trip to the South Island</a> we
 stayed around Wanaka cragging and hiking. Although the Darrens were <a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/02/weather-incredible-footage-of-milford-rd-washed-out-by-torrential-rain-shows-the-extent-of-damage.html">still washed out</a> during our
visit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remarkables">The Remarkables</a> feature some multipitch climbing. In particular, our borrowed Queenstown guidebook listed a dozen climbs above <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/remarkables-conservation-area/things-to-do/lake-alta-track/">Lake Alta</a> (aka <a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Lake_Alta">Dimrill Dale</a>). We'd go to Lake Alta and then up to Double Cone and find a moderate climb.

# To Lake Alta

Alpine starts are well advised but difficult, especially after
riverboarding the previous day, having dinner in Queenstown with
Waterloo students on exchange, and getting back to our Frankton airbnb
at 9pm. We managed to leave the airbnb 30 minutes after sunrise and
drove up to the <a
href="https://www.theremarkables.co.nz/">Remarkables ski field</a>. It
shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's driven in New Zealand, but
Google Maps estimated that the 16km would take 25 minutes. In this
case, the last 13km to the ski field also gain 1300m of elevation. I very
much appreciated motorized
transport here. In any case, we got to the
parking lot at 8:30am. This meant that we had 11 hours 30 minutes before sunset at
8:00pm.  One would think that would be fine for a relatively short
climb.

Turns out that the ski field was in the middle of putting up a <a
href="https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1910/S00554/ground-breaks-on-the-remarkables-new-sugar-bowl-chairlift.htm">new
chairlift</a>. It was interesting to see how they staged the
materiel. And we got to enjoy occasional construction noise (plus
dynamiting later in the day).

</a></p>


The guidebook said that getting to the top of the Alta Chairlift (1km,
126m gain) would take 20 minutes, while mapy.cz said 30 minutes. We
got lost, bushwhacked, and it took us about 30 minutes. The actual
trail is class-1 gravel. Another 35 minutes (1.25km, 166m) got us to
Lake Alta at 9:30. (The Internet says 30-45 minutes).

# The Approach
From there it looked like we were close to the base but we took another
hour to get around the lake on a climber's trail and only by 2:39pm did finally we
get to the base of our climb, George, which was supposed to be 5 pitches
(grades 14, 14, 13, 14, 9). That last part of the approach also involved 400m
of elevation gain.

</p>

I think that the guidebook's 1h30 of approach is from the end of the
Lake Alta track.  We still exceeded that by quite a bit, especially
including the amount of time it took to confirm the route. We had some
discussion about what to climb, and the fact that I hadn't brought
double ropes from Canada was somewhat limiting. (Can't bring
everything, alas, and something I'm regretting more as we're in line to be
here for ski season.) The scree climb at the end of the approach was
tiring because of elevation gain, but it was fairly solid, especially
compared to Rockies scree.

We heard that sometimes people see keas around the Remarkables
but we didn't see any.

However, we did see a chamois. We were wondering why someone would import chamois to New
Zealand. Apparently <a
href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/things-to-do/hunting/where-to-hunt/otago/central-otago-and-the-remarkables-hunting/where-to-hunt/remarkables-wye-creek/">hunting</a>
is allowed.

# The Route
Pitch difficulty and routefinding was manageable for the first three
pitches, although I felt like I didn't always put anchors in optimal
places. I don't know how this happened, but it felt like the top of my
p3 was near p4 in the book. But that doesn't really make sense,
because the book says that the first three pitches should be 140m. I
had a 70m rope. One of the pitches was the full 70m but others were
far shorter. Pitch 4 was supposed to be rock at grade 14 but I did a
scramble/grass climb instead, avoiding what was in retrospect the
Petit Couloir. I had a couple of look-arounds at the base of pitch 4
and noticed the Petit Couloir rap anchor.  All pretty confusing. Bolt
anchors help a lot for routefinding, and there weren't any here.

<p style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 0"><a href="https://gallery.patricklam.ca/picture.php?/8759/category/1221">
<img style="display:inline" src="https://gallery.patricklam.ca/_data/i/galleries/2003-queenstown/200311-double-cone/20200311_150442_grassy_climb-xs.jpg"></a>

In any case, the climbing was quite reasonable (especially compared to
other New Zealand climbs) and we were at the top 3.5 hours after
leaving the bottom. Pitches went at about 40-50 minutes each,
including setting up gear anchors. This got us to the summit (Double
Cone North Peak) at 17:55, so 2 hours before sunset.

</p>

# Descent
The guidebook discusses two options: if one summits Double Cone vs
not.  The "not" option wasn't available to us, not just because we
were on the summit, but also because it supposedly requires 50m
rappels. (One never really knows but it sucks to find that the 50m
rappel is actually required).  So the instruction was supposedly
"either traverse to Single Cone and climb down the descent route or
scramble down the Grand Couloir". I was hoping that the descent would
be clear from the summit, but it totally wasn't. We downclimbed to the
couloir. Looking at it now, the guidebook says "a steep rock slab
leads to an exposed arete", which looked 5th class to me.

Note: I'd taken pictures of the book but MP wanted to take up the
actual book. That turned out to be quite useful.  Navigation was still
hard, but would have been harder from dodgy photos. Taking someone who
has been on the route would be easiest.

In any case, we decided that the rap down Petit Couloir would be best;
rappelling looked like a better bet than downclimbing potentially
steep and wet terrain.  There were 3 or 4 sling rappel stations. Only
once did we knock down big rocks. We got to the end of the rappels at
8:00pm having lost 100m of elevation. So that left us 500m of elevation
to lose after sunset.

<p style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 0"><a href="https://gallery.patricklam.ca/picture.php?/8768/category/1221">
<img style="display:inline" src="https://gallery.patricklam.ca/_data/i/galleries/2003-queenstown/200311-double-cone/20200311_194146_mystery_walkers-xs.jpg"></a>

</p>

The scree was tiresome and, as always, harder to descend than to
ascend.  It turns out that it took us 3 hours to get back to the top
of the chairlift (advertised as a 1h30 approach, and which took us 5
hours on the way in, but not at top speed). Navigation once we got to
the lake looked like it should be easy but was harder than expected
and we almost got cliffed, having to go out of our way to walk
down. MapsWithMe's trail indications eventually got us back to the
trail.

Getting to the car took us another 40 minutes in the dark even on
super easy gravel for a total of 15 hours car-to-car.

# Back to Queenstown and Wanaka

Going downhill in the car we chased a pair of bunnies for a good 2km
at 20km/h and saw a possum on the road. We then picked up Yingning and
her friend in Queenstown (our arrival time kept on getting later) and
drove to Wanaka.

# Splits

Stats: 3km one-way, 623m elevation gain.
