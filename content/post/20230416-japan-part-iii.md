summary:    "The last segment of our Japan trip: skiing and birbs in Hokkaido, as well as snowshoeing and katte don. Plus most of a day in Tokyo."

---

The final segment of our trip, after the 11 hour train ride, was in
Japan's northernmost island, Hokkaido.  (Japan also claims 4 of the
Kuril islands, and the Ainu used to live there, but the Russians hold
the island now.)

There used to be a [5-hour
ferry](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/travel/japan-to-russia-on-a-five-hour-ferry)
covering the 160km from Wakkanai in Hokkaido (not [Waikanae, New
Zealand](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1517)) to
Korsakov in Sakhalin, but that doesn't seem to run anymore.

Anyway, we planned to go skiing and hopefully see red-crowned
cranes. Hokkaido is pretty remote and we planned the last day of our
Japan Rail Pass to include a train from Sapporo to Kushiro, which is
pretty far even in Hokkaido, but there are even more remote parts.

# Day 7: Sapporo, February 24

It's not really the snow on the sidewalks that's slippery. What's most slippery
is the icy crosswalks on the street.

## Market and disappointing crab sushi

We got out of the hotel at 8:30 and walked 1.2km to the Nijo market.
What we saw of the market was kind of small, basically one street with a bunch of stores
(and "no photography" signs).

Sapporo is famous for crab sushi. At the market there were a lot of huge crabs for sale.
I guess the storeowners are tired of tourists taking pictures of the crabs and not buying them.
There were also a couple of restaurants with crab sushi and lines. We went to one with no lines.
Turns out that ours was somewhat underwhelming, and cost us ¥7100 for breakfast for two.

## Skiing

Next, we caught the local Limited Express train to the end of the
line, Teine (16 minutes), and took the 10:20 bus to the [Sapporo
Teine](https://www.powderhounds.com/japan/hokkaido/sapporo-teine.aspx)
ski area (22 minutes). On this Friday, the first bus left us behind, but there was
a relief bus right afterwards.  There are clearly not enough buses to
meet demand, and the every-two-hours weekday
[schedule](https://sapporo-teine.com/snow/lang/en/access.html) is
somewhat lacking (plus 8:55/9:15/10:20, and hourly on weekends).
Still, it does get to the ski hill.

{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20230416-japan-part-iii/teine-landscape" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">View from top of Teine Highland. #teinenow.</figcaption>
</figure>

Next up, we needed to store our stuff, get rental gear, and lift
tickets.  I should first mention that Sapporo Teine is almost two
resorts, linked by a gondola: Olympia and Highland. The gondola gets
you to the top of Olympia/bottom of Highland.  We got off the bus at
Olympia; it is the first stop, and the easier terrain is there. But,
everyone else also went to Olympia.

It was a struggle to find a locker, but we did manage, by going
downstairs, and splitting our gear among two smaller lockers. Neat feature:
you can open a small door in the locker to access your stuff without
ending the rental session.

Highland has the high-performance gear, so I should have gone there.
Instead, I got crappy rear-entry boots and average skis, after a
one-hour wait. Definitely not as good as my early-2000s Volkl 6*
all-mountain skis (admittedly not much floatation on those). So, when I was
skiing Kitakabe ("super expert") 5×, I experienced an insufficient-DIN
wipeout once. But there was definitely soft bumps on that steep run.
("Miseibi" = powder).

MP also enjoyed snowboarding. She tried skiing at first, but that didn't work.
It has been too long. She was able to maneuver around on the snowboard though.

It felt expensive to rent ski gear, but lift tickets were cheap compared to
many places in North America. (Newfoundland is an exception; stay tuned!) We ended up
paying (for 2) ¥9,200 for lift tickets and ¥16,200 for gear. Skiing is expensive.

Most people did not wear helmets. Certainly I did not want to lug a helmet around Japan.

| cost |&nbsp;&nbsp;| description |
| ---: |---| --- |
|¥4,600 || 4-hour lift ticket |
|¥1,000 || helmet |
|¥1,000 || single item hat/gloves/goggles |
|¥5,900 || ski set |
|¥7,100 || high-performance skis |
|¥7,300 || ski/snowboard free exchange |

## Back to Sapporo

After a half day of skiing, it was time to take the bus back to Sapporo Teine. Once
again, this bus was at capacity. The driver managed to get all of us onboard at Olympia.
He left behind a family at the stop after. Sucks to be them.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Packed bus; shinkansen coming to Hokkaido.</figcaption>
</figure>

Also, when we got to the train station, we learned that the commuter train (takes 10 minutes) was
broken, and we had to take the bus (takes an hour). Actually we got onto the metro as soon as possible,
but that didn't save much time; it was more comfortable, though.

We got back to the Sapporo train station with 35 minutes to spare. Overall, getting to the ski
hill by transit was doable but not the most convenient. Try that in North America though. (I know that
it's possible at [Mt Seymour](https://mtseymour.ca/) in North Vancouver.)

## Onwards to Kushiro

Today's ekiben was fried chicken (quite a bit), pastries, salmon,
lemon cake, and mochi desserts. The wait for the fried chicken was a
bit sketchy compared to the departure time of the train, but it all
worked out, and the chicken was delicious (and does not go on top of
sushi, unlike what people may think in New Zealand).

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Food we got for the train; arrival in Kushiro, the end of the line.</figcaption>
</figure>

All ways of getting from Sapporo to Kushiro are pretty slow (on the
Japanese scale) for travelling 301km. The train is 4.5 hours.  Driving
is about that too. One could fly, but that's more expensive and you
have to get to and from the airport. Anyway, we arrived at 10pm, and
then our Japan Rail Pass expired.

The Comfort Hotel was just across the street. Can't get much more
convenient than that!  Kushiro is pretty far out and also
depopulating, so it was also just ¥8,820, or roughly half as expensive
as Tokyo.

# Day 8: Kushiro, February 25

I've had really epic hotel breakfasts in Asia.

Comfort Hotel Kushiro did not provide an epic hotel breakfast. It was very average,
as they say in NZ. Here, you can see. The room was good though.

## Kushiro cranes and snowshoeing tour

I'd arranged for guide [Hirofumi-san](http://dekoboko.biz/) to take us around Kushiro. He is
working on providing adventure tourism opportunities around Kushiro.

Besides us, there was another (Japanese) client, who was then going to
take a bus to Rausu, even more remote than Kushiro. And yet, the guy
was not a birder. MP says the Japanese guy looked perpetually
embarrassed, presumably about us and our gaijin ways.

Hirofumi-san was impressed that I was a fifth dan in judo.

Usually, MP does not like being part of groups or guided tours.
In this case, it was a lot easier than renting a car. And transit was just
infeasible for our schedules. A group of 3 is pretty small, anyhow.

The itinerary included famous red-crowned crane places Otowa Bridge and Tsurui-ito Tancho Sanctuary.
Apparently they aren't always there, but they sure were there when we were. Also we saw the
raccoon dog and a couple of other birds: goosanders, goldeneyes, whooper swans, and crows.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Dancing red-crowed cranes at Tsurui-Ito.</figcaption>
</figure>

We also had some light adventure: snowshoeing in the Kushiro Marsh
observatory. It's a walk in the woods with cookies and tea in the
middle. Also we saw a white-tailed eagle. The snow wasn't actually
that deep and we could have bare-booted. Often one can.

</figure>

We dropped off the Japanese guy at the bus station and then
Hirofumi-san took us to Washou market. In terms of buying tourist crap, it's kind of like
a Japanese version of St. Jacob's Market in Waterloo.

But also, it has katte don ("as you like"), which is far superior to anything at St. Jacob's. You get
rice and then you buy servings of sashimi to create your own chirashi sushi. Delicious!

## Thoughts about Kushiro

Seems to me that Kushiro is a small and isolated Japanese city that is
depopulating. We saw very little of it, but we did drive past the
factories that were shrinking. I guess that, as with everywhere, it's
the big cities that are really growing, along with a selected set of
smaller cities (for idiosyncratic reasons, e.g. Waterloo and
universities).

## KUH to HND

Kushiro KUH: another new-to-me airport. Too far to walk. Hirofumi-san dropped us off at the airport
nominally 2 hours early, but actually 3h15 early because of a 1h flight delay. Flying on JAL,
we didn't have lounge access, but I also don't think there were any lounges to have access to.
There was an airport restaurant which we didn't need, as well as a moderate level of airport shopping,
maybe 3 or 4 stores.

</figure>

The JAL flight was fine. Security was efficient. We got back to Haneda
1h48 later. I'd wanted to go seek refunds from Air Do in person but they
were in a different terminal and that would have taken a long time to
get to.

## Tokyo

Haneda is much closer to central Tokyo than Narita! Still, Tokyo is a
big city, and it took us 22 minutes by local train to get to Sengakuji
station.  This wasn't really that far and so it was pretty cheap; our
rail pass had expired.  Then there was a confusing-to-us transfer at
Sengakuji and a 37 minute subway ride on the Mita line to get to
Akebonobashi.

Our room at the Pearl Hotel Shinjuku Akebonobashi was fine, but it did cost ¥15,121 (vs ¥8,820 in Kushiro).
Clearly more people want to stay in Tokyo. We checked in and then grabbed some dinner at [Coco Curry](https://www.ichibanya.co.jp/english/), a chain
with good crab croquette curry and also good air circulation.

Sapporo is supposed to be wintery and cold. Tokyo was not snowy but it was still
quite cold on our walk to Golden Gai. There are lots of nightclubs. I had no interest
in going to nightclubs. So we walked around and took some pictures (trying the
prime 35mm APS-C f/2) and took the subway back to Akebonobashi, which still was a
small neighbourhood with stuff in a big city.

# Day 9: Tokyo and out, February 26

Our last day in Japan. We had flights out at around 6pm, so we would
have the better part of a day in Tokyo.

I arranged to meet up with SE alum Rew, who came in to Shinjuku for the day from the suburbs
(around Kawasaki, if I remember, not so far from where we had gone to the cherry blossoms).
With expired SIM cards, the rendezvous was somewhat tricky, but we eventually managed.

The first order of business was ramen at [Soushi Menya
Musashi](https://jw-webmagazine.com/shinjuku-restaurant-guide-vol-4-menyamusashi-1b3d4d57f788/):
rich pork-belly ramen and dipping noodles. We were close to first in
line at their opening time of 11, which is good, since the line got long.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Dipping noodles, and pork belly ramen.</figcaption>
</figure>

Then we walked around Shinjuku, visiting the Hanazono Shrine and Antique Market, also next
to the Shrine Raden. There were a few cherry blossoms, though not peak
and not a huge number.

[Rons week](https://www.instagram.com/ronsweek/) was playing on the bridge above the train tracks.
They don't seem particularly famous but there were a bunch of people with fancy cameras recording them.
Dunno?

I got some hardware (phone stand and USB memory stick) at Don Quijote,
which has a wide variety of stuff. The phone stand is OK, I guess. It's hard
to get a phone stand that really ticks all the boxes. This one doesn't quite keep the
position well enough.

We did not enter the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden with a ¥500 entry
fee, though I'm sure it was well tended. Crossing the street to get to
the entrance was pretty hard, though it wasn't quite a car sewer in
the way that Hespeler Rd in Cambridge or Blvd Taschereau in Brossard
are.

Got a replacement tuque at Mont Bell, replacing the one I'd lost.
There weren't many tuques. Back home, I'd order another one on the Internet.

## To the airport

We left for Narita at 1438, taking the Narita Express; not going to
miss the plane this time!  We arrived at the airport at
1600. Unfortunately there is no longer Star Alliance lounge access for
guests on different flights, but we got some sushi and bought a bunch
of omiyage (KitKat, cookies) for friends, family, and students.

MP's flight was delayed, but I still had a bit of time in the lounge.
I saw quite good air quality and snarfed some food.

Then, I boarded my NRT-YYZ Air Canada flight. I sat in my economy seat
19A and then the gate agent came and said something like "Sorry for
the inconvenience. We have a new seat for you, 12A" (which was in
PY). "Thanks, I really appreciate that." The flight attendant asked
"why are you going that way?"  "Because the gate agent gave me a new
seat." Better yet, 12B was empty. I guess that the operational upgrade
was due to two no-shows (or cancels) and Y being overbooked. Overbooking
for the win!

I quite enjoyed my flight to Toronto, landed just in time to take the
flixbus (which was 5 minutes late), then took an Uber home from the
bus stop.  I forgot where I'd put my keys, oops. Had to rummage
through all my bags to find my keys. But, I had also had enough time
to write [Part 1](/post/20230226-japan-part-i) of this trip report
enroute, and posted it once back home. All ready for teaching the next
morning at 11:30.
