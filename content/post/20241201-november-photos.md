This month, I processed 50% more photos than usual (and produced other content as well). Easier to do when not travelling and not actively submitting papers. There are a lot of sets and there are some big sets in there.

It's always hard to know how to count sets for the month in progress. Anyway, I removed 22 sets from the queue and added 7, with only 3 net-new sets from November 2024 that I didn't process immediately.

The "earliest unprocessed" set pointer moved from November 2022 to December 2022. There are tons of pictures from December 2022 though (in 15 sets). Not sure I'll get through them in December 2024. But, after December 2024 and 5 days from January 2024, the next set is August 2023.

# Smaller October trip to Flagstaff (October 2024)

# Hīkoi mō Te Tiriti (October 2024)

On November 19th, perhaps the largest demonstration ever in Aotearoa's history converged on Parliament in defence
of the Treaty of Waitangi.

# Aorangi Crossing (November 2024)

I joined this Wellington Tramping and Mountaineering Club trip to do the Aorangi Crossing,
which would normally be somewhat logistically complicated because it is not a loop. There was
a fair amount of elevation gain and loss over slippery terrain, but we had great views on the
last day. Not sure about the effort-to-reward ratio. 33km, +/- 1860m elevation gain/loss.

* [Aorangi Crossing day 2: Pararaki Hut to Pinnacles road end (46/94), November 24](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1996)
