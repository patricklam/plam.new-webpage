I was thinking that I haven't had to deal with the [401](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Highway_401) lately, and grateful for that.
Most of the drive between Waterloo and Montreal is on the 401. I try to
go by car at most once per year, combining it with transporting bulky items by car. I'll have to drive it at least once
in December. Hopefully no more than once (trying to figure out logistics right now). It is a boring drive, and I hate driving.

But not just that. I don't think there is a comparable drive in New Zealand, both because of the geography and because
of the built form and the population distribution.

For more thoughts on historical NZ travel patterns, see my review of Emerald Hours: [part 1](/post/20210905-emerald-hours/)
and [part 2](/post/20211011-emerald-hours-ii/). I've also written about how to get [out of Waterloo](/post/20191226-travel-from-waterloo/).

# The Corridor: Linking Canada's Urban Centres

The elephant in the room is Toronto-Montreal, which is the core part of what VIA Rail calls 
the [Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_City%E2%80%93Windsor_Corridor_(Via_Rail)).

Clearly Toronto is to Canada as Auckland is to New Zealand. 

Statistics Canada says that Greater Toronto had 6.4 million people and
Montreal 4.0 million as of 2016.
Here I mean the
Toronto of most Canadians alive today: Montreal used to be the
metropolis of Canada, but not anymore, with
[Toronto](https://www.macrotrends.net/cities/20402/toronto/population)
overtaking
[Montreal](https://www.macrotrends.net/cities/20384/montreal/population)
in population in 1975 per the links.

OK, but what about the [second
city](http://nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz/wbos/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLECODE7979)
of New Zealand? Probably Christchurch. Canterbury region has 649k residents 
compared to 547k in Wellington, compared to Auckland's 1.7M. The comparison is
flawed for at least two reasons: population ratios are way off, plus there's the
Cook Strait in the way. The Christchurch/Wellington ratios are closer than the
Toronto/Montreal ratios, but there's still the body of water.

(The Montreal/Quebec ratio, at 5×, is even more skewed than Auckland/Christchurch at 2.6×).

# Transport patterns

OK, what about other transport around Canada and New Zealand?

## Cars and holiday travel

What to do about people who want to [leave Auckland for the
holidays](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/300448608/covid19-the-40000-cars-in-the-way-of-aucklands-border-opening-for-christmas)
was a big open question due to COVID being suppressed in Auckland and eliminated elsewhere. Until December 15, only [permitted
travel](https://covid19.govt.nz/travel/permitted-travel-at-different-alert-levels/personal-travel-across-an-alert-level-boundary/list-of-permitted-personal-travel-across-an-alert-level-boundary/)
is allowed into and out of Level 3 areas (Auckland and a few adjacent areas). I'm sure Canada-US border crossings handle more than that
([Buffalo-Niagara Falls,
NY](https://theimtc.com/border-data/national-ranking/) reports 4.8
million for the year, and that would be bursty), but there's dedicated
infrastructure. In the end, NZ decided to have a selective
enforcement approach. I'm sure that'll be great for marginalized
people.

Lots of people leave Greater Toronto on the 401 on long weekends as
well: I've seen the hours of inbound traffic on Monday afternoons (fortunately I was going in the
opposite direction). Unlike commuting patterns, the cars are actually
pretty packed, i.e. not single-occupant. I think NZ has a similar traffic pattern out of Auckland,
but I haven't been there at that time.

### The surface transportation network

Both Canada and New Zealand spend a lot of money maintaining highways.
In Southern Ontario and out to Quebec City, there's a lot of what
would be known in the UK as dual carriageway: divided, four lanes (two
per side). I think all 400-series Ontario highways are (over)built to
this level. New Zealand has motorways in and around the major cities, but
otherwise it's often two lanes, and the main routes go right through
smaller towns (NZ SH1 is more like US Route 66 than an Interstate,
Ontario 400-series highway, or Quebec Autoroute).

The speed limit in New Zealand is often 100, though I got a ticket
(video) once for driving 105 on the motorway outside Dunedin. It's 100 on major highways in Ontario
and 80 on country highways (90 in Quebec). I often feel like 100
is awfully fast on back roads in NZ. And then there are the one lane
bridges in NZ, which definitely feel sketchy.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Gananoque, a stop on the 401; Wellington Motorway (not the Decarie Expressway in Montreal); extra sketchy NZ one-lane bridge (mutual exclusion not guaranteed); Wellington Motorway again.</figcaption>
</figure>

The Cook Strait means that the ferry
([Interislander](https://www.greatjourneysofnz.co.nz/interislander/)
or [Bluebridge](https://www.bluebridge.co.nz/)) is an important part
of the transportation system. This body of water makes things more difficult.
PEI and Newfoundland have similar issues (a bridge to PEI was a joining-Canada condition; the Confederation Bridge finally got built a century later),
while it turns out that Vancouver can be cut off by flooding. Central Canada is easy to connect.

In New Zealand, the [InterCity](https://www.intercity.co.nz/) network seems relatively 
extensive: more so than the ever-shrinking Canadian inter-city buses. I don't really want to get into this
more except that Greyhound Canada was really not into providing service for reasons and MegaBus Canada was picking up some of the more-lucrative routes.

## Trains

Yeah, nah. I would say that both Canada and New Zealand don't have serious
train transportation networks in 2021. 

### Commuting

In New Zealand, Auckland and Wellington have pretty decent commuter
train networks, with limited commuter service to Hamilton from
Auckland recently introduced, and to Palmerston North from Wellington.
NZ's Hamilton and Palmerston North could be described as satellite
towns about 2 hours of road transport away from their major centres;
they'd benefit from at least two-way all day service, though I'm not
sure the numbers would work out based on population. Christchurch used
to have trains, but now doesn't.

Montreal and Toronto both have extensive commuter train networks reaching 
out to the exurbs as well. Toronto's commuter train reaches its Hamilton;
it's a comparable commute. The Toronto-Hamilton service is hourly all-day 
service, which is acceptable frequency. Speed could be faster. Vancouver 
has a lot of local transit (SkyTrain) but no commuter trains.

### Inter-city

The only other frequent train in Canada is on the Corridor,
which accounts for the vast majority of [VIA
Rail](https://www.viarail.ca)'s service. It is a viable inter-city
service and the Montreal-Toronto time is reasonable, especially for city centre to city
centre. VIA Rail has proposed [High Frequency Rail](https://corpo.viarail.ca/en/projects-infrastructure/high-frequency-rail).
There have been some funding announcements, but I'll believe it when I see it.

Both Canada and New Zealand have various tourist trains. These
train routes have been, and could be, viable transport for normal people,
but aren't right now. (There are also train services to
[isolated](https://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/trains/regional-trains/montreal-senneterre)
[Canadian](https://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/trains/regional-trains/winnipeg-churchill)
[communities](https://www.qnsl.ca/horaires), but I'll leave that out
of this discussion). Canada has VIA 001/002, the
[Canadian](https://www.seat61.com/train-from-toronto-to-vancouver.htm),
along with a few other services, and New Zealand has the
[TranzAlpine](https://www.greatjourneysofnz.co.nz/tranzalpine/), the
[Coastal
Pacific](https://www.greatjourneysofnz.co.nz/coastal-pacific/), and
the [Northern
Explorer](https://www.greatjourneysofnz.co.nz/northern-explorer/). I
have taken many of these services to get from Point A to Point B, in
both Canada and New Zealand, but people usually don't.

## Planes

I think the fact that NZ is much smaller than Canada (it's UK-sized)
makes a big difference here. Also the Cook Strait. All NZ domestic
flights are short-haul (max 2 hours Auckland-Invercargill) and have not been very expensive: I usually pay
under NZ$100 one-way and only sometimes up to $250, for Air New
Zealand flights. (Also I've had 0 delayed bags on Air New Zealand; the
expected number in North America would be more than 0 given the number
of flights I've taken.) JetStar is a competitor. Trains (and ferries)
really should be viable given the distances involved; they're viable in the UK,
after all, though with more population density.

</figure>

On the other hand, where would I go in Canada?  Of course, I've gone
to a lot of places (I've set foot in all provinces and 1 territory),
but routinely it's the Corridor, which I prefer to travel by train,
even if it's [annoying to get to Union Station](/post/20191226-travel-from-waterloo/).  In the range of places that are NZ-distance
from me in Waterloo, there's Montreal and Quebec City. Quebec City is
too far for land travel. Toronto-Montreal has massive air capacity (more than VIA Rail of course),
though the last flight from Montreal is surprisingly early, 9:30pm last I checked.

</figure>

The psychologically comparable trip to Toronto-Canmore (Calgary) is Wellington-Queenstown.
I'd expect to pay at least $250 one-way to get to Canmore. There is also Vancouver
as well as other smaller centres, but the ones I'd want to visit are not cheaper
to get to. But, OK, it is legit tougher to build a competitive train network
in Canada than in NZ.

As a total red herring, the Cook Islands really do need planes to connect
the islands in any sort of timely way. [Air Rarotonga](https://www.airraro.com) provides that service.
It's expensive. The flight to Aitutaki was much more like scheduled air service while the flight to Atiu
felt much more like general aviation.

Analogously, there are regional operators in New Zealand like [Sounds
Air](https://www.soundsair.com/), [Air
Chathams](https://www.airchathams.co.nz/), and [Barrier
Air](https://www.barrierair.kiwi/), all of which I've taken, along
with the ones whose planes I showed off above. I also had a ticket
booked with Fly My Sky, but then they stopped operating and I
chargebacked the ticket. In general, the NZ regional operators aren't
expensive either. In fact I find NZ travel pretty affordable
compared to North America, but that's beyond the scope of this post.

# Conclusion

Looks like the transport networks in Canada and New Zealand are incomparable due to 
geography. The UK might be a better bet, but I'm unqualified to write anything
about the UK's transport network.

In practice, I leave Wellington using the plane: might as well if I'm
going to the South Island, and many places on the North Island are
further than I want to drive (plus I have no car). In Canada, I can
get away with leaving Waterloo by train to Montreal, sometimes
including a bus to get to Toronto. But otherwise it's also usually by plane.
There aren't that many trips I'd take by car from Waterloo, except for Toronto and for climbing
on the Escarpment. That's a function of both lack of destinations and lack of infrastructure.
