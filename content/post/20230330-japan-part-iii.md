summary:    "A walk around the mountain (Taranaki). Pretty chill except for day 3 which had super high winds and day 2 which had a short amount of muddy steep terrain."

The final segment of our trip, after the 11 hour train ride, was in
Japan's northernmost island, Hokkaido.  (Japan also claims 4 of the
Kuril islands, and the Ainu used to live there, but the Russians hold
the island now.) We planned to go skiing and hopefully see red-crowned
cranes.

Hokkaido is pretty remote and we planned the last day of our Japan
Rail Pass to include a train from Sapporo to Kushiro, which is pretty
far even in Hokkaido, but there are even more remote parts.

There used to be a [5-hour
ferry](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/travel/japan-to-russia-on-a-five-hour-ferry)
covering the 160km from Wakkanai in Hokkaido (not [Waikanae, New
Zealand](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1517)) to
Korsakov in Sakhalin, but that doesn't seem to run anymore.

# Day 7: Sapporo, February 24

It's not really the snow on the sidewalks that's slippery. What's most slippery
is the somewhat icy crosswalks on the street.

## Market and disappointing crab sushi

We got out of the hotel at 8:30 and walked 1.2km to the Nijo market.
What we saw of the market was kind of small, basically one street with a bunch of stores
(and "no photography" signs).

Sapporo is famous for crab sushi. At the market there were a lot of monster crabs for sale.
I guess the storeowners are tired of tourists taking pictures of the crabs and not buying them.
There were also a couple of restaurants with crab sushi and lines. We went to one with no lines.
Turns out that ours was somewhat underwhelming, and cost us Â¥7100 for two.

## Skiing

Next, we caught the local Limited Express train to the end of the
line, Teine (16 minutes), and took the 10:20 bus to the [Sapporo
Teine](https://www.powderhounds.com/japan/hokkaido/sapporo-teine.aspx)
ski area (22 minutes). On this Friday, the first bus left us behind, but there was
a relief bus right afterwards.  There are clearly not enough buses to
meet demand, and the every-two-hours weekday
[schedule](https://sapporo-teine.com/snow/lang/en/access.html) is
somewhat lacking (plus 8:55/9:15/10:20, and hourly on weekends).
Still, it does get to the ski hill.

Next up, we needed to store our stuff, get rental gear, and lift tickets.
I should first mention that Sapporo Teine is almost two resorts, linked
by a gondola: Olympia and Highland. We went to Olympia; it is the first stop,
and the easier terrain is there. But, everyone else also went to Olympia.
Highland has the high-performance gear, so I should have gone there.


Skiing/snowboarding
crappy rental skis

excellent snow, Kitakabe ("super expert") 5x had slope and soft bumps ("miseibi" = powder)

Return bus was also at capacity and left people behind at the next stop, sucks for them.

Broken local train, bus + subway was an hour instead of 10 minutes, got to Sapporo with 35m to spare

fried chicken, fish, lemon cake, mochi desserts

4.5hr train to Kushiro, arrive 10pm, rail pass expires

Comfort Hotel Kushiro

# Day 8: Kushiro, February 25

Hotel breakfast not what we were hoping for.

Guide Hirofumi-san took us to Otowa Bridge, Tsurui-ito Tancho Sanctuary, Kushiro Marsh observatory snowshoeing,
Washou market: katte-don
Mysterious Japanese guest.

Dropped off at airport, no lounge, waited at airport for 3h15 (1h flight delay)

Back to Haneda 1h48 later.

22min local train, cheap (rail pass expired)
37min subway to Akebonobashi

stayed at Pearl Hotel Shinjuku Akebono-bashi, pretty pricey for what it was (well, it was in Tokyo)

had Coco Curry for supper (good crab croquette curry) & took walk to Golden Gai

# Day 9: Tokyo and out, February 26
