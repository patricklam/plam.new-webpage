summary:    "A walk around the mountain (Taranaki). Pretty chill except for day 3 which had super high winds and day 2 which had a short amount of muddy steep terrain."

The final segment of our trip, after the 11 hour train ride, was in
Japan's northernmost island, Hokkaido.  (Japan also claims 4 of the
Kuril islands, and the Ainu used to live there, but the Russians hold
the island now.)

There used to be a [5-hour
ferry](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/travel/japan-to-russia-on-a-five-hour-ferry)
covering the 160km from Wakkanai in Hokkaido (not [Waikanae, New
Zealand](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1517)) to
Korsakov in Sakhalin, but that doesn't seem to run anymore.

Anyway, we planned to go skiing and hopefully see red-crowned
cranes. Hokkaido is pretty remote and we planned the last day of our
Japan Rail Pass to include a train from Sapporo to Kushiro, which is
pretty far even in Hokkaido, but there are even more remote parts.

# Day 7: Sapporo, February 24

It's not really the snow on the sidewalks that's slippery. What's most slippery
is the somewhat icy crosswalks on the street.

## Market and disappointing crab sushi

We got out of the hotel at 8:30 and walked 1.2km to the Nijo market.
What we saw of the market was kind of small, basically one street with a bunch of stores
(and "no photography" signs).

Sapporo is famous for crab sushi. At the market there were a lot of huge crabs for sale.
I guess the storeowners are tired of tourists taking pictures of the crabs and not buying them.
There were also a couple of restaurants with crab sushi and lines. We went to one with no lines.
Turns out that ours was somewhat underwhelming, and cost us ¥7100 for two.

## Skiing

Next, we caught the local Limited Express train to the end of the
line, Teine (16 minutes), and took the 10:20 bus to the [Sapporo
Teine](https://www.powderhounds.com/japan/hokkaido/sapporo-teine.aspx)
ski area (22 minutes). On this Friday, the first bus left us behind, but there was
a relief bus right afterwards.  There are clearly not enough buses to
meet demand, and the every-two-hours weekday
[schedule](https://sapporo-teine.com/snow/lang/en/access.html) is
somewhat lacking (plus 8:55/9:15/10:20, and hourly on weekends).
Still, it does get to the ski hill.

Next up, we needed to store our stuff, get rental gear, and lift
tickets.  I should first mention that Sapporo Teine is almost two
resorts, linked by a gondola: Olympia and Highland. The gondola gets
you to the top of Olympia/bottom of Highland.  We got off the bus at
Olympia; it is the first stop, and the easier terrain is there. But,
everyone else also went to Olympia.

Highland has the high-performance gear, so I should have gone there.
Instead, I got crappy rear-entry boots and average skis. Definitely
not as good as my now super-old Volkl 6* skis. So, when I was skiing
Kitakabe ("super expert") 5×, I experienced an insufficient DIN
wipeout once. But there was definitely soft bumps on that steep run.
("Miseibi" = powder).

MP also enjoyed snowboarding. She tried skiing at first, but that didn't work.
It has been too long. She was able to maneuver around on the snowboard though.

Prices: 5700 ski set, extra amount (1600) to change skis to snowboard, high perf 7100,
helmet 1900, 1 item 1000.

After a half day of skiing, it was time to take the bus back to Sapporo Teine. Once
again, this bus was at capacity. The driver managed to get all of us onboard at Olympia.
Not so much at the stop after.


Return bus was also at capacity and left people behind at the next stop, sucks for them.

Broken local train, bus + subway was an hour instead of 10 minutes, got to Sapporo with 35m to spare

fried chicken, fish, lemon cake, mochi desserts

4.5hr train to Kushiro, arrive 10pm, rail pass expires
