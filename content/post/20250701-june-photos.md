More work and travel in June and so a smaller number of pictures. Some of the sets were pretty small, so that the number of sets is comparable, but only half as many pictures. About 50% of the pictures I processed this month are from May, making up 7 sets, but there are still 10 more sets from May to process. And my Shanghai/Seoul/Narita trip added a lot of pictures, especially from Shanghai and Narita. I don't take that many pictures from inside the conference hall.

# Wānaka ski trip (August 2023)

* [Cardrona day 3 (31/77), August 22](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/2081)

* [Wānaka to Wellington (19/50), August 24](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/2083)

I've had "write up skiing trip report" for a long time. Maybe I'll never get to it. But I at least finally processed
the pictures. The Southern Alps is super picturesque, especially in winter, and certainly in Eastern North
America we don't see greenery when skiing.

Too many pictures from Estonia (and they're not all done yet), but here are three sets of selections from them. Also,
a trip report.

Not many good pictures from this trip, but that wasn't the point. Well, it's never really the point, but
especially this trip.
