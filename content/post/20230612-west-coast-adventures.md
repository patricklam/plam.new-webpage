After lectures ended and before Nationals, I had an epic trip to the West Coast of North America in May. This was really the first trip since 2020 where I saw a bunch of people. I owe many thanks to people who hosted me. Turns out I can just show up in many places and people will host me. Maybe that doesn't work if I do it too often.

# YYZ-SFO

The flight was at 8am and the lines were long (45 minute NEXUS
security/US border line). I returned my rental car at YYZ and caught
my flight, though without much time to spare.

## Thanks

In SF, I first met up with Feng from grad school at McGill, one of a
trio of tech layoff people I met up with on this trip.  He picked me
up from SFO and we hung out for the day at his place, with a walk
around the nearby Arastradero Reserve, as well as lunch.  Then he
dropped me off at Christina's place in the city.

# Eastern Sierras

Next up: ski touring in the Eastern Sierras.

After driving to Mammoth Lakes, I got some rental AT skis at Mammoth Mountaineering Supply,
and then we did a short ski tour at Mammoth Rock. Gear all worked out great.

The nice thing about being based in June Lake, and presumably Mammoth too, is that there are
a bunch of ski tours accessible without much driving. You have to drive 7 hours to get there,
but once you're there, you don't have 2 hours to drive to get to the mountain every morning.
You have 10 minutes to drive. That time savings adds up, but makes it hard for friends to visit.

The next day was the big one, Mount Wood, which isn't trivial: took us 9 hours and had 1500m of elevation
gain. Great mountain views and passable snow conditions. Lots of views of Carson. Made it to the false summit
but it was getting late and did not make it to the real summit not far away. The ski down was a lot of elevation
loss right to the parking lot, and the snow was pretty heavy, though got a bit better halfway down.
I think it's generally harder to gain elevation in skis versus on a good-quality (class 2) hiking trail.
The rental AT skis were still lighter than my telemark skis, so that helps, but some foot shape weirdness
was bugging me. Rebooting (boot off and on again) helped a bit. I also applied sunblock, but should have
re-applied it, because I got pretty burnt. Best to avoid that happening too many times. (Even once is not ideal).
Spot the dog was pretty tired after running around all day. Pizza in June Lake was great afterwards.

</figure>

We then looked for something much more mellow. Devil's Slide, at 548m
of elevation gain, fit the bill. We skinned up through the forest and
then skiied down on much better snow (in the shade) than on Mount
Wood: it was much lighter and easier to turn on. We ran into a guy
bootpacking up the slide itself. Excellent rest day activity and great
meal at [Dos Alas](https://www.dosalascafe.com) in Mammoth Lakes after
going shopping at Mammoth Mountaineering Supply.

</figure>

Then it was time to head back to San Francisco. Well, I had a flight
at noon the next day, so it would be technically possible to stop at
Truckee, but definitely more risky. We did another visit to Devil's
Slide after bidding Lucas goodbye, and bootpacked directly (not in forest) two thirds
of the way up. Good chance to test out my
new gear. Navigation worked well. Had lunch in June Lake with a plate
lunch from Ohanas 395 and a Russian (stroganoff) hand pie from Pies of
the World in Placerville (which seems like a touristy town).

## Thanks

We (well, mostly Christina) drove to the Eastern Sierras via Christina's ski lease in
Truckee. Christina drove all of the 7 hours there; I drove part of the way back.

Lucas took us out skiing for 3 days.  Since he lives in a van, it's
hard for him to provide accommodation. Christina managed to book a
place in June Lake for us with two rooms. Super handy.

John-Kyle, who lived right next door to our accommodation, came out skiing
with us on Mount Wood, and also lent me ski poles.

It was super useful to have local knowledge, since I don't spend much
of my time ski touring in the Eastern Sierras. We climbed Mount Wood,
Devil's Slide, and the Mammoth Rock Bowl. Thanks also to Lucas and
Christina's patience while I went shopping, before we went to eat.

The night before flying to Vancouver, Christina hosted me in her spare
bedroom in SF, and then she drove me to the airport.

# Vancouver (briefly)

After the Eastern Sierras, it was back to Vancouver on an SFO-YVR
flight. I took the SkyTrain from the airport downtown to meet
Marcus. We decided to not spend $60 each (!!!) on visiting the Capilano
Suspension Bridge, but did visit the nearby Cleveland Dam, and went on
an impromptu trip to check out the Chief in Squamish. It was too rainy
to climb on the weekend, though we did see boulderers in the boulder field at the base of
the Chief.

## Thanks

Marcus drove me around Vancouver, to West Vancouver, and we went on an
impromptu trip to a somewhat soggy Squamish. He also drove me back to
my airbnb. Then, the next day, he drove us to to Seattle.

# Seattle

I then stayed put in Seattle for the work week. Well, except for a day
out at Mount Rainier. I spent Monday doing my [April report](/post/20230508-april) and
[Western Newfoundland report](/post/20230507-western-newfoundland), Tuesday at
a workshop, Wednesday around and under Seattle, Thursday at Rainier, and out early morning Friday
(taxi companies let me down for my 6am flight so I had to take an Uber at twice the cost).

I also crashed at Aaron and Anna's new place on Wednesday night to
facilitate an early start for ski touring at Rainier. Aaron drove us up to
Rainier and then we had excellent and untracked snow conditions on the Paradise
Bowl.

## Thanks

Many thanks to Marcus for hosting me for almost a week in Seattle,
from Sunday through Friday. Also I borrowed his cruiser bike to get
from West Seattle to the University of Washington, a good 23km ride (Ã— 2 for roundtrip)
over a couple of bridges.

Thanks to Ardi, Zach, and the [PNW PLSE](https://pnwplse.org) crew for
inviting me to keynote the workshop. It was fun to talk about [Hot
Takes on Machine Learning for Program
Analysis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PqIhzYytfMKjmxPz-B34TWwC27XNcZxC6B8uaYg_ssU/edit). And
special thanks to Ardi for taking me to the [Bill Speidel's Seattle
Underground Tour](http://www.undergroundtour.com/).

Also thanks to Aaron and Anna for letting me use their spare bedroom
and to Aaron for driving us to Rainier.

# Nelson

Next up was visiting my cousin My Tram in Nelson. I arrived in Castlegar
after taking the super early 6am flight from Seattle to Vancouver
and then a 9am flight from Vancouver to Castlegar. Because I had to wait
for my skis (and couldn't short-check them), I did not manage to
take the city bus from Castlegar to Nelson, but the shuttle
with the friendly driver was only $50. I let myself into My Tram's place
and worked on the Director's Cut of my PNW PLSE talk, to be delivered
at UBC shortly.

The next day, we watched as Grant finished a half-marathon ("Run like
a Mother" in Nelson for Mother's Day) and visited the Nelson Saturday market (more banh mi!). Also went to famous cafe (for Nelson) Oso Negro.

I managed to get a hike in on Sunday before it got too hot. [Pulpit
Rock](https://westkootenayhiking.ca/pulpit-rock/) is worth doing. High
dog-to-people ratio. Not crowded like the Adirondacks, but there were
people. Past Pulpit Rock it is possible to go all the way to CBC Tower
and beyond.  Way fewer people and not really worth doing in May. The
snow is annoying.  Could have used snowshoes, if they would have
worked. I also dropped in on the [Cube](https://cubeclimbing.com/)
(small) and chatted with the staff about the nearby bouldering, which
seems abundant.

</figure>

I decided to fly out of Nelson via Trail and Pacific Coast Airlines.
There is a bus that goes from Nelson to Trail. It doesn't line up
great with the flight schedules, but I waited in the [Bridgeview
Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/thebridgeviewcafetrail/) for a few hours,
enjoying a cheese pastry and keeping a zucchini chocolate loaf for later.
The demographic was digital nomads and retirees. There was another $45
taxi from central Trail to the airport. Still a better deal than the Seattle Uber.

## Thanks

Thanks to My Tram for putting me up in her extra room (in addition to
her new airbnb). I also borrowed her bike to get out to a hike. Tat
ride was much quicker than the Seattle ride!  Only 4.5km each way,
rather than 23km. I provided the service of assembling a table for her
airbnb. I also appreciated the dinners that My Tram and her
ex-father-in-law treated me to.

# Vancouver and Squamish

The last leg of the West Coast part of the trip was to Vancouver,
after a bus/taxi to Trail and a flight from Trail Airport (YZZ) to
YVR-South over the mountains.

The logistics in Vancouver this time was that I rented a car from YVR
(the wait for the car was 30 minutes, ugh) and would return it the
next day before going to UBC.

</figure>

I stopped by the Squamish Library for a few hours. Then, since the
weather was good, I managed to get out cragging at Smoke Bluffs in
Squamish with Brad and Becca, and stayed over at their place.

I left for Vancouver early in the morning (to avoid traffic, especially
on the Lion's Gate bridge), dropped off the car, took transit downtown, met up
with SE alum Sandy (who is starting a master's at UBC in September),
and continued to UBC.  Then I gave the Director's cut of my talk to a
crowd of about two dozen. It was good to talk to faculty and students
at UBC's Software Practices lab.

After dinner at East By East, I made my way to the airbnb near YVR
(only two wrong buses). This was a repeat visit; it might well be the closest non-airport hotel-accommodation to YVR.
6am flight back to Toronto the next day. In fact, it is close enough
to the airport to walk, and I managed to lug all my stuff to YVR,
rather than taking another Uber. 6am flights still are the worst but
surprisingly common in my life.

## Thanks

Thanks to Brad and Becca for the climbing and hospitality!

Thanks also to Alex for organizing my UBC visit and taking us all out
to East by East afterwards.

I definitely appreciate all the hospitality on my first West Coast
trip since 2019. Thanks again!
