I was thinking of this tip even before things got exciting, but it applies even
better now in these times of social distancing.

This week's tip: get natural sunlight!

It's easy to be a nocturnal Software Engineering student. I don't
recommend it. As human beings, we do benefit from exposure to natural
sunlight and the resulting Vitamin D. In Spring in the northern
hemisphere, the associated extended daylight hours would normally be
making it easier to do this. Even now, though, regularly taking
outdoor walks with your family should be a safe and healthy
activity. It'll help with cabin fever and is a welcome change of pace.

Below: a good illustration of my note from two weeks ago "<a
href="/post/20200302-getting-down/"> you also have to descend</a>". We
are above Lake Alta (aka Dimrill Dale in Lord of the Rings) having
finished the roped-up part of the descent at sunset. There were,
however, 3 more hours of walking, including 2 on moraine (rocks on
steep slopes).
