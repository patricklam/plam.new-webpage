As of January 1, I'm on sabbatical again, this time for a full
year. Yay!  Let's get some papers written and accepted. 2023
wasn't too bad either, though I'll reflect on that in a separate post.

How about those hybrid courses? It's good to take courses and upgrade
skills; that's one way of learning. See [below](#online-courses) for more discussion.  As I wrote last month, I had the
in-person parts of a Wilderness First Responder course (Seattle, 5
days) and Avalanche Skills Training 2 course (Nelson BC, 4 days) lined
up for December.

On the work front, I got an acceptance for our Empirical Software
Engineering submission; reviews which look kind of negative for our
Foundations of Software Engineering submission (we'll see what our
response does); and a journal paper rejection (which I'm complaining
about). There were a lot of things in-flight in December. Now there's
just PLDI, FSE, and NSERC in-flight, plus my email to the journal
editor.

Turns out I also did a bunch of consulting for the WLU SE program.

Up next, I have some more volunteering work I'd better do for the OAC,
as well as 6 PLDI reviews.

# COVID

Really not over, as JN.1 points out to us. [China is probably doing
worse](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/chinas-crematoriums-running-24-hours-31745065)
due to less vaccine uptake and large population. Anecdotally, I know
four people who got COVID over the holidays, and wastewater says that
this is the second-highest peak in the US after Omicron. See [Eric
Topol's State of the
Pandemic](https://erictopol.substack.com/p/sotp-state-of-the-pandemic)
for more. He points out that JN.1 should cause us to revise our
estimate of an Omicron-like event upwards from 15-20%-in-two-years. We
could improve ventilation and wear more masks, but people don't seem
to be doing that. [Mucosal
vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-04003-4)
(paywall) will probably work eventually, he says.

OK, what about Long COVID? Yep, still happens.

* [Gill Deacon (CBC radio host) on her debilitating Long COVID experience](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/gill-deacon-long-covid-recovery-narratives-1.7046731)
* Gideon M-K, an Australian epidemiologist, was pretty worried about COVID initially, but is less concerned now, and says that one's chance of getting Long COVID is pretty low now. There is a [Substack post](https://gidmk.substack.com/p/the-ongoing-risk-of-long-covid) and a [Medium post](https://gidmk.medium.com/the-future-risk-of-long-covid-56557ef7f9fa), but the Medium post is paywalled, and who pays for Medium?!?

Clearly it still is better to not get COVID than to get COVID, and
I'll continue to wear a mask where there are lots of people, like
airports and buses.

# Professional

December is typically pretty quiet (unless one is trying to submit a paper).
I gave a talk at Amazon, and Moh and I wrote a response to our FSE reviews.
Let's say there are 16 work days in December. I worked on 11, and (slightly disjoint)
worked on WLU-SE-not-my-day-job on 8.

## Grad students/mentees/collaborators

Since I was on tour, I managed to meet with a number of my students
and mentees.  I had in-person meetings with Mohammad, Ardi, and Alex
(in Wellington, Seattle, and Montreal). In total I had meetings with
mentees/students on 7 days. There are going to be no in-person meetings
in January and February. Maybe March.

Also had one-off career mentoring of an SE 2019 grad from Auckland
Airport under the pohutukawa tree.  The strange story about that was
that I was going to do it from Wellington airport, but Air NZ moved me
to an earlier flight (!) so we scheduled the mentoring session for
when I'd be in Auckland instead. Also recovered the headphones
I'd left on an Air NZ flight while passing through AKL (!).

## Collegiality

Reviews: Journal of Cloud Computing (while at WFR), revision of a
TOSEM submission.  PLDI reviews to start in January. Finished with
FAUW service for now, attending the early-morning (for me) General Meeting in
case there were any questions (there weren't).

## Consulting

We handed in a first version of a first deliverable for WLU SE. I have
some more things that I'd like to write up to describe our intent,
but I guess now we wait a bit. I billed 17.45 hours in December.

# Trips

Maybe delaying the New Caledonia report was unwise in retrospect, because
now I have that trip and the mega-Christmas-trip to report on. Anyway,
the two trips in December were the tail end of New Caledonia, plus
Seattle/Montreal/Nelson. In the interests of getting this out the door,
I am only going to write a paragraph about each of them.

## New Caledonia

Couple of days on Ouvéa, which was easy to get around by hitchhiking
but hard to rent a car and hard to plan events; then the rest of the time on the
Grande Terre, where we visited two provincial parks (Grandes Fougères and Rivière Bleue) and
also the Koghis, getting some hiking in, as well as mountain biking and kayaking, and not seeing
the birds hidden in the canopy for the most part.

## North America

* Landed in Seattle, gave a talk at Amazon, went for a walk at Tiger
Mountain with Aaron, worked in the library, went to IslandWood on
Bainbridge Island for the WFR, visited Macrus and then off to
Montreal, leaving a pouch of cables and cards somewhere.

* Five days in Montreal, with MP coming on day 3. Went to a solstice party.
Did *not* catch COVID. Met up with 3 other people. Bought a bunch of gear
for the avalanche course, discounted (though hard to source in Montreal).

* Flew to Castlegar, leaving on 25 December, staying near YYZ, and
arriving at YCG two days before the start of the course. My flight was
not cancelled, but my boots took an extra day to arrive somehow. Took an avalanche
course. My new thin (85mm underfoot) skis don't really work in the Kootenays. I just sink.

## Travel planning

Didn't plan for any future trips this month. Too busy executing trips.
The next trip coming up is Nelson NZ for judo training camp, then Sydney
for a summer school.

# Movement statistics

Surprisingly OK amount of walking for the activities I had this month
(not much walking during the WFR for instance; and just the Tiger Mountain hike). New transport
mode: REM. Plus the Bainbridge island ferry to get to the WFR.

* 🚶 Walking: 119km on 27 days (average, same as November)
* 🚲 Biking: 25km on 3 days (mostly when not in Wellington)
* 🚗 Driving: 915km on 17 days (5 in New Caledonia, 4 in Seattle, 3 in Montreal, 6 in Nelson)
* 🚗 Taxi: 51km (airport to judo; out to IslandWood on Bainbridge Island; shared taxi from Castlegar to Nelson)
* ⛴ Ferry: 30km (to/from Bainbridge island)
* ✈ Plane: 22,439km (NOU-AKL-WLG, WLG-AKL-YVR-SEA, SEA-YYZ-YUL, YUL-YYZ, YYZ-YVR-YCG)
* 🚌 Bus: 29km on 3 days (Wellington and Montreal)
* 🚆 SkyTrain: 28km
* 🚆 REM: 13km (Montreal to Brossard)
* 🚇 Metro: 72km
* ⛷ Skiing: 21.5km ski touring during AST 2 (not including 1 lift ride)
* 🚣 Kayak: 3.6km (Parc de la Rivière Bleue, New Caledonia)

## Walks

All the organized walks were in New Caledonia.
* [Parc de la Rivière Bleue](https://www.sudloisirs.nc/fr/produit/combine-vtt-kayak-riviere-bleue-351/): mostly biking on the itinéraire principal, but also walking and kayaking
* Parc des Grandes Fougères: [sentier du pic Monnier](https://www.sudtourisme.nc/offres/sentier-pedestre-du-pic-monnier-farino-fr-2783771/) (jaune), at super slow unsuccessfully-looking-for-birds pace
* [Pic Maloui](https://balades-naturalistes.fr/le-pic-malaoui-le-chapeau-de-gendarme-par-yahoue/) at the Koghis, hoping to see some birds

Also, in Seattle:
* [Tiger Mountain Trail](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/tiger-mountain-trail)

# Pictures

Only really one day of Turkey 2015 photos left. I guess the question is whether I take more pictures than I process. 11 out, 12 in. Oops. Here's what I processed in December:

* [Balloons in Goreme, May 30](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1804)
* [Red Valley, May 30](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1803)

I processed pictures from Reading Week in Montreal in February 2022. Couldn't go to NZ that year, and
MP wouldn't have been able to re-enter NZ until April 13 if she had left. What a time.

# December posts

None.

# Miscellaneous

Mostly on the move this month.

## Acquisitions

Bunch of avalanche gear.

* [Kathmandu Polypro Unisex Gloves M](https://www.kathmandu.co.nz/mens/accessories/gloves-and-scarves/polypro-gloves.html?colour=386&scroll=instant): more liner gloves just in case.
* [Arc'teryx Rho gloves, green](https://www.outsidesports.co.nz/products/arcteryx-rho-gloves): even more gloves, this time not black!
* [BCA snow saw](https://www.lacordee.com/fr/scie-a-neige-backcountry-access-35-cm-baa-c1818001010), 50% off (lots of deals at La Cordée).
* [Snow ruler 2m](https://avalanchequebec.ca/produit/regle-pliable-2m/), also 50% off.
* [Helio ski crampons 97mm](https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_GB/product/helio-crampons/), 50% off, yet again I buy crampons that I don't use.
* [Ortovox Pro Alu Shovel III](https://www.ortovox.com/us-en/shop/categories/p50691-avalanche-shovels-shovel-pro-alu-iii), Boxing Day 25% off, replacing my ancient and obsolete G3 shovel.
* [G3 Speed Avalanche Probe 320](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5025-903/320-speed-tech-probe), 25% off at MEC, hard to buy 320cm probes in Montreal, also replacing ancient gear.
* [Black Diamond Ultralight Ice Screw](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5059-782/ultralight-ice-screw), 25% off. I now own one modern ice screw, in addition to the 4 ancient ones I've never placed.
* [Backcountry Access Aluminum Crystal Card](https://www.backcountrygear.com/aluminum-crystal-card/), full retail price.

So I replaced a bunch of actually obsolete safety gear (it still
works, for the most part, but not as well as modern gear). There were
a lot of pre-Christmas outdoor gear sales in Montreal. I wonder if
fewer people are going outdoors now that COVID is not keeping people
outside as much?

## Online courses

OK, let's not talk about the IJF Academy. The in-person part is
surprisingly cheap, though, including lodging for a week for US$300?
Just have to get to a suitable place. Probably Japan.

The hybrid Wilderness First Responder means fewer scenarios vs fully
in-person. There's still a bit of lecture, though I guess
less. Probably if I had done a hybrid course before my recert a few
years ago, I would have felt more up to speed when the course
started. Also, having a course in December is a bit of a weird timing. Lots
of Seattle locals and not many outdoor pros. Pros would have had to
cert earlier in the year because the season has now started.

The AST2 really used the hybrid nature to add an extra field day, which
was great. I feel like I got a good idea of what's around the Kootenay
area in terms of backcountry skiing. (The crux is getting there!)
The group was pretty experienced and moved fast. My skis don't really
provide enough flotation for that snow. This course had some things where
we were supposed to respond to the content, though I don't know that
anyone actually read that.

## Sports

Oh boy. One judo practice and one bouldering session at Fergs. Then
again, I was only in Wellington for 6 full days in December. Hard to
keep up a routine with that much travel. Some of the travel was
active. Other parts of it not so much, e.g. holidays and first aid
courses. Though ideally the first aid helps with keeping future
activities safer.

## Books

No books. Read some of my enqueued magazines.

## Restaurants

The scale suggests that I have been eating out a bunch in December. Time to get back on track.

Nouméa, New Caledonia:
* [La marché de la Moselle](https://www.noumea.nc/noumea-pratique/services-population/marche-moselle): real farmers' market in Nouméa
* [La Terrasse du Hilton](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/noulphi-hilton-noumea-la-promenade-residences/dining/): reasonably fancy hotel breakfast buffet
* La Gavotte crepes: proper crepes in New Caledonia

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20240104-december/food-new-caledonia" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Crepe; breakfast at La Terrasse.</figcaption>
</figure>

Seattle: I seem to have made it to a bunch of midrange places which serve original, tasty food.
* [Fogón Cocina Mexicana](https://www.fogonseattle.com/): the US generally has better Mexican food than Canada and NZ, and Fogón delivered with some well-executed tacos.
* [Sugar Bakery](https://sugarbakerycafe.com/): croissant kept me going before giving a talk
* Pho Saigon: I had a pho, which was what I expected
* [Noi Thai Cuisine](https://www.seattle.noithaicuisine.com/): large servings, right downtown, quite busy; more upscale.
* [IslandWood](https://islandwood.org/): good food even when not catering for weddings!
* [Kilig](https://www.kiligseattle.com/): post hike dinner, midrange but super tasty Filipino food
* [Theo's Gyros](https://www.theosgyrosseattle.com/) food truck
* Gõ Seattle banh mi: filling-heavy, legit
* [The Birdhouse](https://www.thebirdhousews.com/): has a pop-up feel but makes good breakfast

<figure>

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Tacos at Fogón (lengua?); cheese croissant from Sugar; pho; Kilig calamari dish; gyro fries from Theo's Gyro's; Noi Thai; IslandWood food; another croissant, from Birdhouse.</figcaption>
</figure>

Wellington:
* [Night Flower Punch House](https://www.nightflower.nz/): no menu, you can get punch or custom cocktails
* [Mama Kitchen](https://www.mamakitchen.co.nz/): pretty good Chinese food

Montreal:
* [Il Focolaio](https://ilfocolaio.ca/en/): downtown Montreal pizza (many choices) in Carré Philipps
* [Aldea](https://www.aldeamtl.com/): salt codfish; I guess that's not supposed to be super flavourful

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20240104-december/food" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Mama Kitchen (Wellington); Il Focolaio, Aldea (Montreal).</figcaption>
</figure>

Vancouver:
* Guffo Café (did I say how hard it was to find a coffee place open early in Vancouver? Also, no one there.)
* [Bonjour Banh Mi](https://www.bonjourbanhmivan.ca/): good banh mi just off the SkyTrain (but otherwise kind of in the middle of nowhere), super popular with nearby construction workers

Nelson:
* [Desi Donair](https://www.desidonairdelivery.ca/): correct poutine with donair meat; on a second visit, the desi wrap was good but the fries were not
* [Empire Coffee](https://empire-coffee.ca/): best breakfast sandwich ever per MP, quite affordable
* [Dragonfly Cafe](https://dragonfly-cafe.ca/): scone powered me through the morning of a ski tour
* [Cantina Del Centro](https://cantinadelcentro.ca/): there is a reason we don't see fish quesadillas usually
* [The Black Cauldron](https://www.theblackcauldron.ca/): our New Year's Eve meal, including soup

<figure>

## Volunteering

Many things continued from November.

I started this in November: once upon a time I developed a judo club membership database
Menba. It's still running, but I was doing a PHP upgrade on the server
and that required more updates to the PHP code as well. Software upgrades, joy.

I had an OAC Board meeting and some mailing list maintenance; we seem
to have successfully migrated from MailChimp to Buttondown, which is
working well enough so far, and we sent a newsletter.  Also parcelled
out some work for the refereeing committee which I should get to doing
and wrote some meeting notes.

# Conclusion

Was hardly in Wellington! Not so much work in December. Will do more in January while on sabbatical,
plus as many hikes as I can find time for. Fewer trips coming up in January for sure.
