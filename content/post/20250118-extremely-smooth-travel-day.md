I was definitely playing with fire, returning from Tahiti to
Wellington via Auckland, arriving on January 4th at 11:20, and then leaving for
Toronto on January 5th at 9:30. Especially all on separate
bookings. Fortunately, everything worked out, and both I and my 55kg of luggage
got back to Waterloo efficiently.

# Prelude: back to Wellington

Flights to and from Papeete (Tahiti) on Air New Zealand are
inconveniently timed for passengers, and we had a 3am departure from
Papeete on January 3. After checking out of our bargain-basement
airbnb (had a lie-down on the bed in the garage) near the airport
(still a 2500XPF ride even if just 3.1km), I was pleasantly surprised
to have lounge access at Papeete, where we had some snacks and enjoyed
the air conditioning. MP left the lounge just a bit earlier to spend most of our
last Pacific Francs (XPFs). We crossed the International Date Line, so
that the 5 hour flight leaving at 3am arrived on January 4 at 7:40am.
Landing in Auckland, I checked that there was no available earlier
flight, and so we took our scheduled 10:10 flight arriving at 11:20 on
January 4, with a quick shower in the Auckland lounge.

# Packing

I had put a bunch of things that I definitely wanted to bring back to
Canada in one place in our Wellington flat. It took a few hours, but I
got everything into one suitcase, one 40L backpack, the monitor box, and two carry-ons
(one tiny). I had gotten the suitcase a few weeks
earlier for $20 at the op shop in Karori and brought it back on my
bicycle; the two suitcases I had brought to Canada two months ago in
October were (1) still in Canada or (2) in the dumpster.

# To WLG and WLG-AKL

The WLG-AKL ticket was a return itinerary on a WLG-AKL-WLG trip, with
the outbound back in March 2024, when I was flying to Edmonton and
Vancouver.  The original return was scheduled for 8:15AM but there was
a schedule change and I changed to a 9:30AM flight.

Once in a while there is bad weather and flights don't get in or out
of WLG, but today was not such a day. Just a normal partly cloudy day
with some wind (of course).  I got MP to come with me in the
Uber&mdash;wasn't going to either take the cable car or transit to the
airport with, most notably, a bulky monitor box.

I had to shift some paper between bags and then all of my bags made
the 23kg Air New Zealand weight limit and she didn't have to take
anything back to our flat in Wellington. The bags were 23.4kg
(suitcase), 17.3kg (backpack), and 13.3kg (monitor box). Air Canada
will let me check 3 bags each up to 32kg, but not Air New Zealand.  In
fact for WLG-AKL I had to buy a seat + bag fare, plus a 2nd bag for
$35. Still, that was $55 for baggage overall (now $65), not
unreasonable. For my earlier trip to Ontario in October, I'd verified
that if the Most Significant Carrier was Air Canada, then I would get
the AC allowance, but here I had 3 separate itineraries.

Anyway, I checked my bags and went to the Air New Zealand
lounge at WLG.

# AKL

Mā te wā, Air New Zealand! This was my last flight in New Zealand for
the next few months while I'm in Canada teaching. I had the Cookie
Time cookie and the tea with milk. I did not see Taranaki. On my first
Air NZ flight back in 2020, I had the corn chips (no longer available)
and did see the maunga.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Cookie Time cookie (and cup of tea); approaching Auckland; AKL tarmac; <br> baggage claim at AKL domestic; bags retrieved (first test passed).</figcaption>
</figure>

At AKL, I soon enough had my checked baggage (always fast in NZ),
including monitor. I loaded on a cart and got ready for the 10 minute walk
to the International terminal. I'm not a fool (at least not on this
occasion): my arrival was at 10:38am and my departure was at 2pm.
Plenty of time!

I saw some family lose bags off their cart going between the Auckland
domestic and international terminals.

I got cocky with my cart, and so I did have had one spillage incident.
There was insufficient static friction and a bag rolled off my cart. I
was careful about the sidewalk ramps, but that's not the only way to
fail.

I took quite a
bit of time taking the scenic route in the terminal (with my 5 bags on
a cart) to the Air Canada checkin desk, where there was a huge
line. 

Taking the significantly less huge priority line, I did have a small
problem with the width between a bollard and a post being a bit too
small to smoothly navigate with the wide monitor box on my cart.  Had to back up and try again a few times
and got help from a bystander. At
the other priority checkin desk, there was a party of 4 having some
passport issue. My new passport worked just fine for checking in. With
NEXUS I don't actually need a passport to enter Canada, though the
airline doesn't care about that.

I talked to a guy
from Alberta taking his preteen son on a New Zealand trip while
waiting to check-in. ("Nah, you don't really want to tip in NZ,"
though maybe it's OK if it's your private driver/tour guide.)

</figure>

All in all, though, I only got to the Air NZ Lounge at noon: transferring
at AKL was pretty slow, really. This time there was tasty beef being
grilled at the lounge, as opposed to the also-tasty scallops on Christmas Day.

# AKL-YVR

Soon enough it was time to board the flight to Vancouver.
Coincidentally I had flown YVR-AKL on Jan 3 2024, so here I was flying
the reverse leg a year and two days later.  This also was a return
segment from the trip I took to New Zealand in March; there
were some nested trips in between, notably the October
[Toronto/California/Winnipeg trip](/post/20241116-big-trip-ontario-california-manitoba).

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20250118-extremely-smooth-travel-day/boarding-passes" >}}
</figure>


This time, the flight was full in all classes. I had put in for an
upgrade but that didn't work, despite being #3 on the waitlist. I
think they upgraded 0 to business.

I was therefore surprised to see, upon boarding, that the seat next to
me (14J) was inoperative.  I found out, from the flight attendant,
that the seatbelt was broken. So that was really good: I could put my
crap on the empty seat. Inoperative seats can successfully hold belongings.

(I spend a lot of time optimizing flying, and I was wondering what one
could do if bumped off that AKL-YVR flight.  I think the best bet is
to request involuntary reroute via the Air New Zealand flight and
request original credit due to involuntary reroute. One should be able
to get the same or better class of service. And in that case my
original YVR-YYZ flight would have worked as well, though more on
YVR-YYZ changes below.)

Despite having all the space I could want and a reclining seat,
though, I rarely get any sleep on a flight that leaves at 2pm and
arrives at 2am. It really doesn't work with my sleep schedule,
alas. The YVR-AKL direction has better timing for sleep, leaving near midnight
Pacific time.

In transit, I did manage to do another pass through our TOPLAS journal submission.
At least I could do that if I couldn't sleep. I also noticed that the moving map on
Air Canada flights now can display information on nearby points of interest, presumably drawn from Wikipedia.
It was interesting to see the places that I've been to in the South Pacific (Rarotonga, Noumea, Tahiti),
as well as places in New Zealand obviously described by locals (who knows about [Four Square](https://www.foursquare.co.nz/)?). Also they imported a bunch of
place names from craters on Mercury and the Moon.

The food was good. The wine in Premium Economy is much better than in
Economy but less good than in Business. The breakfast is the economy
breakfast, but that's not the fancy meal for this, or any, flight. On
the transatlantic flights, Air Canada breakfast used to be really
lame, like a banana bread, but on the transpacific flights it is an
omelette.

The flight arrived at 0530 and I got my luggage at 0545. My bags were
the first ones on the carousel. Somehow, for YVR, they considered the
monitor to be not oversize luggage, and it rolled right out onto the
normal carousel.  Good thing the monitor was well packed in the
original box. I was back at the check-in counter at 0555 with my
luggage. Scheduled arrival time was 0610.

# Checking in for YVR-YYZ

I was booked on a separate one-way ticket for the 1600 flight, which
arrives at 2322. Not ideal given that the first day of classes was the
next day, but it did minimize the chances of misconnecting. I made
sure to buy a Flex fare, which allows confirmed same-day changes for a
modest fee (formerly $75, now $100). The Comfort fare with free standby wouldn't be
useful: it's always been unclear to me whether one can stand by with
checked luggage. And I most definitely had checked luggage on this flight!

On the AKL-YVR flight I tried to use the in-flight internet to check
availability on YVR-YYZ flights, but the internet was spotty and I got
basically no information.

Anyway, the morning flights were: 0630, 0700, 0910, 1015, and 1125. The check-in
deadline is 45 minutes before, so 0630 wouldn't have worked given that
I was at the counter at 0555.

At the premium check-in desk, I got the competent check-in agent Nicholas.
Unlike some previous premium check-in experience at YVR, I didn't have
to argue about my resident visa being sufficient to enter NZ.

Sunday, January 5th turns out to be a super busy travel day (end of
holidays for many, including me). I learned that, even though they
were still selling full-fare Latitude tickets for the 0630 and 0700
departures, all of the flights I listed were in fact oversold&mdash;so
they were overbooking.  They got away with it, though, because I saw
that some people cleared from the standby list.

Nicolas had a chat with revenue management on my behalf (he went and
disappeared somewhere for like 10 minutes). They knew that there were misconnects at
1125 and they made a seat for me on that flight. In fact the seat they
found for me was 12A, which is a good seat (even if you can't put bags
by your feet, not so bad on a mid-length flight). I was happy to pay
my $105, including GST. Apparently the Air Canada computer code for
same-day changes is still FLAT, referencing [flat-tire
policies](https://thepointsguy.com/airline/airline-flat-tire-policy-missed-flight/),
even if it's actually that you arrived 10 hours early for your flight.
In any case, the 1125 flight was otherwise full in economy and had 3
free in business. I also asked to be put on the eUpgrade list.  Might
as well, since my points were expiring and I had not used any flying
to Vancouver.

The people at the check-in desk next to me were misconnecting from
Sydney and trying to get to Montreal and they were having much more
trouble getting onto a flight; somehow their party of 2 had gotten split
and one was confirmed on Sunday but the other on Monday.

The 1015 flight showed as full in all classes and I hadn't even asked
to get onto that one.  It turns out that they eventually took 3 off
the standby list for that flight.  (How does one find this out?
Looking at the Air Canada app.)

# Richmond

OK, so it was 6:30 AM and I had re-checked my checked baggage, and I had
5 hours until flight departure. Time to walk to Richmond! I'd had previous
experiences taking the SkyTrain to Vancouver on Sunday mornings and not finding
much open. I was sort of hoping for banh mi but that was not to be. I took some pictures
of birds, but it was still too early to get good pictures.

</figure>

I have a Starbucks gift card, but the thing about Starbucks is that
whenever I have a choice between Starbucks and not-Starbucks, I'll
pick not-Starbucks every time.  In this case I walked to Kam Do bakery
in Richmond (5km from YVR), found my Canadian cash, decided I wanted to go to the
bathroom first, was directed to Parker Place, and saw that everyone
(not teenagers, but middle-aged and old Asian people) was at the food
court at Parker Place at 8:40AM on Sunday. Huh.

This time I planned to *not* get any food at the YVR lounge (not falling for the
bad hash browns again), hence the pastries at the bakery.

I did not walk back to the airport. I did get in on the wrong side of
the SkyTrain and had to re-pass the fare gates. I also managed to miss
my stop while texting on the SkyTrain.  Still, I got back to the
airport in plenty of time. And it looks like they only charged me
$3.20 for Vancouver transit. I guess the $5 YVR AddFare is only
charged leaving the airport, and that the cheapest × fastest way of
leaving the airport is to take the SkyTrain to Templeton and walk to
Bridgeport (2km). Not really worth it economically, but not a bad
walk. The whole walk from YVR is good actually, but the SkyTrain shortens it a bit.

# YVR-YYZ

I was #2 on the upgrade list and at 6am there were 3 empty seats in business.
Unfortunately, when I boarded the 737MAX8 serving AC108, they had sold all
these seats, and I took my good economy seat.

<figure>

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Cat on board; post-boarding upgrade; seat 4F; boarding pass; white mesa; J meal on YVR-YYZ; <br> landing in Toronto; baggage collection at YYZ.</figcaption>
</figure>

Sometimes people say that it's "you board, you lose" in terms of upgrades.
You certainly disappear from the upgrade list in the app.

But then I got a text message confirming my upgrade after I'd boarded. YBYL is not true.
I showed the message to the flight attendant and was able to take seat 4F.
Then the gate agent sent over the new boarding pass with "4F" hand-written onto it.
I don't think this is the first time that I've experienced this, either.
Not going to complain!

The seat next to me (not a broken seat on this flight) had a Dal
neuroscience and psychology student who self-proclaimed being bad at
math.  She was planning to move back to BC for family reasons at the
end of the school year.

Anyway, this flight was good as well, and I'm quite grateful that
I managed to get on the earlier flight, and also for the upgrade.
This flight gets one into YYZ at 1900. (Obvious statements: This is later
than 1400 but earlier than 2300).

My bags arrived in 20 minutes and I took my pre-booked taxi to Waterloo, arriving
at 8:40PM, and ready to teach the next day.

Fully unpacking takes a few weeks every time but things are now (3
weeks later) getting towards how I like them to be arranged.
