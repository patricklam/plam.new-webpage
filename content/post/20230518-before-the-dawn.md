summary:    "A review of the Great Japanese Novel, which describes the life of a village chief along a main highway through the opening of Japan to the world and the Meiji Restoration. Kind of the anti-It's-a-Wonderful-World as he realizes that his efforts didn't bear much fruit."

# Context

I've called this the Great Japanese Novel but it's better described as
creative non-fiction. _Before the Dawn_ is the story of Aoyama Hanzō,
who was an official responsible for the post station at Magome in the
Miso Valley around the time of the Meiji Restoration. Magome was
out in the boonies (mountain valleys) but also on the Nakasendō, a key
inland route connecting Edo and Kyoto (the capital at the time). Part
of the deal was that the shogunal regime aimed to prevent the
subordinate lords&mdash;daimyo&mdash;from gathering too much
power. How? By forcing them to invest in real estate. Daimyo had to
maintain a residence in the capital where their families would stay
(taken hostage, as it were), and also in their own domains. The
daimyos thus had to travel along the Nakasendō regularly, and people
had to do a lot of work to cater to their needs.

Hanzō is basically the author (Tōson)'s father. According to the
translator's notes, Tōson did a hell of a lot of historical research
to write the book, and I can confirm that it is super heavy on
historical context. I understand that the details are relatively
accurate, but that the author had to reconstruct the information from
archives, as Tōson didn't know his father that well (see below for an anecdote).

This is not a thriller. It's a brick. I did not want to bring it to
Japan to read, because that was an extra kilogram of luggage to carry
around. I did read it in Magome on my phone, via the Internet
Archive.

I am the wrong person to explain the Meiji Restoration, but the tl;dr
about that historical era in Japan was that the American Commodore Perry came with
his Black Ships and forced Japan to open for trade with the
world. Then the shogun (military leader) resigned and the emperor took
back power. (Ask a historian for a better version). We see the effects
of this major societal change throughout Japan, including in the
cities and in the hinterlands.

# The adventures of Hanzō

Hanzō is an idealistic disciple of the National Learning movement,
which aimed to "restore the ways of antiquity": as I understand it,
the claim was that the shogunate, as well as Buddhism, had deformed
the essential character of the Japanese people and Shinto-ism
(whatever those are). This book is slightly the anti-"It's a Wonderful
Life", and towards the end of the book, Hanzō reflects about how all
his efforts brought no results, both at the national level (they were
establishing the separation of church and state, rather than having
Shinto as the national religion, which was something Hanzō worked on
for a time; and talking about having a Parliament), and at a regional
level (the locals were barred from using the local forest resources,
e.g. cutting down the trees or practicing slash-and-burn agriculture,
and hence in impossible economic situations). The book notes that he
did teach many of the villagers to read, but also that he couldn't get
behind the new curriculum. In any case, to me, the author is aiming to
show National Learning and his father's pro-commoner beliefs in a
positive light, even if he himself converted to Christianity.

An interesting moment late in the book is when Hanzō goes to Tokyo to
visit his third and fourth sons; he'd sent them away to be
educated. The fourth son, Wasuke, is the author. The text describes
how the 12-year old author is so embarassed by the father's provincial
mannerisms. Teenagers! Even one and a half centuries ago and across cultures! Also
Wasuke gets permission to learn English, although the
translator's notes mention that the book is written in challenging
idiomatic Japanese appropriate for the action at hand. (I got
confirmation that the original Japanese of the book is really quite
hard to read in 2023 from Asako, who grew up in Japan).

# Hanzō's End

Hanzō does two major things that are Not Done. First, he throws a fan
into the emperor's carriage with a (pro-emperor) poem, and gets
charged with endangering the Emperor but is eventually not
significantly punished. Second, precipitating the end of his life, he
attempts to burn down the local Buddhist temple. As a result, he gets
locked up in a cage until his death (a few months later), by the
villagers, who are very much afraid of arson in villages made of
wood. Hanzō dies of beriberi, which is a Vitamin B1 deficiency; maybe
that would have not happened if he had not been locked up.

Although the villagers think Hanzō is crazy, after Hanzō's death, the
local priest asks Hanzō's disciples whether it was actually not an act
of insanity, but rather an intentional anti-Buddhist (pro-Shinto?)
act. Through his life, Hanzō had supported the temple, sort of, while
removing his ancestors from the Buddhist burial plot; as with many
human acts, understanding motivations is not straightforward. Even the
author of the acts might not know.

# Discussion

Sometimes we think that we're only started talking about mental
illness in the 2020s, but of course there have been madmen throughout
history and in literature. This book is another perspective on a man
who may or may not be mad; it's up to the reader to decide about
Hanzō.

The translator's notes also say that one can read a lot into what is
not said. I guess. Hard without a lot of context into Japanese
culture, which I do not have. All I know is how to throw and pin
people using Japanese techniques. (Kano Jigoro is also very very much
a Meiji Restoration figure and judo is the thing done by the modern
Meiji man, but neither judo nor Kano show up; an uncle-like figure
is seen practicing his traditional archery.)
