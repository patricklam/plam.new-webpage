This month I processed pictures just up to the end of the month. Marginally fewer
pictures processed than in [June](/post/20240703-june-photos), but I think I took the same number of pictures as I
processed, so just treading water here. The number of sets doesn't tell the whole story,
since sets have different numbers of pictures. New sets is 11.

[Picture
logs](https://www.github.com/patricklam/picture-processing-logs) still
available. As always, pictures are clickable to go to the full gallery.

# Ancient

* [Telemark World Cup, Chamonix, March 2012](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1918): I needed a picture of a race. The crappy camera I had back then (Canon PowerShot SX230HS, 12 MP) did manage to get some pictures of races. Also, that was a small set of pictures compared to today, both in terms of number of pictures and picture size.
