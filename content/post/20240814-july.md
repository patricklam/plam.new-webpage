Once again getting a late start, but I posted the [photos](/post/20240801-july-photos) ~a few days~ two weeks ago. Am mostly
in Wellington for the next month, except for trips on most weekends. The trip report for Australia took a few more days.

# COVID

There is definitely a big wave in North America right now, including [Quebec](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/analysis-quebec-in-midst-of-new-covid-19-summer-wave). There was a small wave in NZ at the end of July, but it seems to have dropped right off. There is still the winter lurgy going around in NZ and I've had a cough for 3 weeks. (The doctor who I saw about it had COVID a few weeks ago). My cough is not COVID, though, if I'm to believe the RAT.

There were two research results that I found interesting:
* [Antihistamines prevent covid infection in mice](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01088-24). Of course, we're not mice, but still interesting.
* [Long COVID rates](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2403211): based on US Veterans Affairs data, 10.42% pre-vaccine pre-delta; 3.50% for vaccinated people in omicron era (still "substantial" per the study).

# Professional

In July we submitted a paper to the
[HATRA](https://2024.splashcon.org/home/hatra-2024) workshop at
SPLASH. Turns out I'll be on the right continent, but the wrong end of
it, to attend the workshop; I'll be arriving in Pasadena the evening
of the workshop after refereeing at the Ontario Open. It was good to
get a first paper out with my new PhD student Alex though.

Worked on 19 days, a large chunk of which was HATRA, and a smaller
chunk preparing my NSERC Discovery Grant resubmission (Common CV (ugh), new reviewers,
lots of related work, some reworking of objectives).

## Grad students/mentees/collaborators

Again, above-average collaboration count: I was talking to my students
and collaborators on 15 days. HATRA was a lot of that.

Also chatted with SE15 grad Michael and some freelance SE student advising.

## Collegiality

Just one review request for TOSEM. On the other hand, I asked 2 friends
to read a paper that I have been trying to get into conferences;
thanks Brian and James! I'm sure their advice will help.

As part of working on that paper, I also prepared a talk summarizing
a previous version of the paper, so that we could consider it in a
different form than written. As authors, we considered the talk and figured the way forward,
and then I also presented it to my students.

## Teaching

I also arranged my teaching schedule
for Winter 2025; most weeks are 3 days a week, which should be OK, though
3 courses in 1 term sounds terrible (not by my choice!)

# Trips

Two trips: Old Ghost Road (West Coast of NZ) and Melbourne/Cairns.

## Old Ghost Road

Oops, I didn't write a trip report. Oh well. I am still working on the Overland Track trip report, with waterfall
day and the last day left. Perhaps I'll write this trip up after that. But I also feel like I'm always doing
writeups. Some writeups are more interesting than others.

I will note that the wild goat pie I had at the [West Coast Pie Co](https://westcoastpies.co.nz/) in Westport
was quite tasty. The meat is hunted. I believe you can't sell hunted meat in Canada.

There seem to be a couple
of attractions in Westport which may be worth going to sometime, like [Kawatiri](https://www.pounamupathway.com/kawatiri/) on the Pounamu Pathway. I'd also like to get to the Westland petrel place again.

In the July part of this trip I also visited the [Centre of New
Zealand](https://nelsontrails.co.nz/centre-of-new-zealand/) in
Nelson. It is not noteworthy enough to go on the [NZ
places](/nz-places) page. I also went back to the library yet again.

## Melbourne/Cairns

[Full trip report: Our long-delayed trip to Melbourne, plus a side-trip to Cairns and the Great Barrier Reef.](/post/20240814-melbourne-cairns)

We had planned to be in Melbourne in March 2020, but for obvious
reasons, that didn't happen.  Four years later we finally managed to
get to Melbourne for a bit. I bought a ticket including 2 weekends,
and then decided to go to Cairns and the Great Barrier Reef during the week
from Melbourne. So, in the end, it was a Saturday/Sunday in Melbourne,
then off to Cairns, back the next Saturday, and then back to
Wellington on Sunday.

We were planning on going for a hike in the Cathedral Ranges,
but the weather was actually uncomfortably chilly and windy. Pretty hostile overall,
and not the weather that we'd brought clothes for.

Instead, we went to the [Dingo
Sanctuary](https://dingofoundation.org/) near where we thought about
hiking, and also Long Forest.

<figure>

</figure>

We got up early on Sunday to head to [Sherbrooke Forest](https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/dandenong-ranges-national-park). After walking for a while we did manage to see a superb lyrebird&mdash;as Alex put it, when you give up hope, then the lyrebird appears. It wasn't in full display, so I was like "is that really a lyrebird?", but it definitely was. And then, except for the lyrebird and the galah, there were tons of birds just at the parking lot (where they used to feed birds).

<figure>

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Superb lyrebird!; two galahs; kookaburra launch; pied currawong; crimson rosella; sulphur-crested cockatoo; cockatoo stare; don't feed the kookaburra.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Melbourne ↔ Cairns Travel

tl;dr: Thanks for nothing, Jetstar. So many delays and annoyingness.

### Cairns

The main point of going to Cairns was to see the famous Great Barrier Reef.
I booked one night on a liveaboard. But then I found several other things to do around Cairns, e.g.
the Wet Tropics UNESCO site. I heard that Daintree was also great, but I thought it was too far for
the time we had.

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20240812-melbourne-cairns/cairns-botanic-gardens-and-esplanade" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Selected Cairns birds: Straw-necked ibis; muscovy ducks; spangled drongo; Australian pelican; peaceful dove; bush thick-knee (that call!!); random non-sidewalked streets in Cairns.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Great Barrier Reef

Here's my hot takes on the Great Barrier Reef. I suspect it's a place
that is better for diving than snorkelling.  The [reef at Aitutaki](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1432) was
far more colourful (bleaching?) and calmer. Here, it was somewhat like a
washing machine when we were out; so much so that MP skipped some of
the snorkels. I did swallow rather more salt water than I would have
liked, though maybe I got a bit better at snorkelling towards the end. Pictures edited for colour.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Great Barrier Reef pictures. Steephead Parrotfish & Checkerboard Wrasse. Various corals. MP snorkelling.</figcaption>
</figure>


### Kuranda Village

This village, not actually very far from Cairns (30km/40 minutes by
car), is really popular with Japanese tourists, including groups of
high school students. MP thinks it's because it seems to be sort of a
nature activity (but not really).

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20240812-melbourne-cairns/kurunda" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Kuranda Scenic Railway train in the morning, seen from the gondola; tropical plants; Birdworld: Alexandrine Parakeet and mandarin duck; sanchezia; Barron Falls; dam at the falls; rail bridge; Kuranda Scenic Railway station; Gold Class sofas; train and Stoney Creek Falls.</figcaption>
</figure>

The train goes through rugged terrain. Building it was quite a feat
for the 19th century, mostly by hand. Booking it still feels being in
the 20th century: I had to call (OK, by cellphone from the Uber) to
book, and then picked up and paid for the tickets at the station. The
equipment is also retro. Gold Class (which we weren't in) seems to
basically have sofas as seats. The train also takes 90 minutes to
cover the 30km, but it does a lot of switchbacks. Anyway, I like
scenic railroads, and here we were, so I enjoyed it. It is a legit
train that transports you between point A and point B, though of
course tourist-focussed.

### Atherton Highlands

There were a lot of stops here! The notes in my book are over half a
page.

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20240812-melbourne-cairns/atherton-highlands" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Lily Creek in Cairns; Lake Barrine; Australasian grebes in Lake Barrine; people unsuccessfully looking for platypus; forest kingfisher; spectacled monarch; bracket fungi; Lake Hypipamee; Dinner Falls on the Barron; orange-footed megapode; not the dog you're looking for.</figcaption>
</figure>

MP thought we should eat in downtown Cairns on a Friday night.  Cairns
is extremely car-choked and lacks good foodpaths. Boo! (Also, entering
the mall which is right in the middle of the city is hard: there is
really only one pedestrian entrance from the street, and there is no
other street activation, just walls surrounding the garage. There's
also the entrance through the parking garage, but who wants that?)

Anyway,
parking was stressful, since many people were downtown.  Lots of
restaurants were busy, but [The MED](https://themedstreetfood.com.au/)
was empty, and had, again, really good food. Melbourne is famous for
food, but we did have many great meals in Cairns.

We stopped at the grocery store on our way out. There was a PA announcement repeated several times, with increasing desperation: "Could the owner of the dog in lane 3 please move your dog?'

### Melbourne Round 2: abbreviated final day

Despite having less time in Melbourne than hoped, we did manage to
meet up with Hanna from the Overland Track for some desserts at [Bing
Chillin](https://www.bingchillin.com.au/) (matcha crown croissant) and
then some last-minute gear shopping at
[Bogong](https://www.bogong.com.au/) (MP got mountaineering boots and
I got new climbing shoes, on sale!). There is more choice in gear in
Melbourne for sure.

<figure>

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Flying CNS-MEL; airside myna; in traffic on the Melbourne SkyBus; matcha crown croissant at Bing Chillin; street photography; lobster bisque ramen from Snow Monkey; Melbourne town hall.</figcaption>
</figure>

After being the last to leave Bogong, we walked over to [Snow Monkey Ramen](https://snowmonkeyramen.com/),
which has a number of unique takes on ramen. I had the lobster bisque ramen, which definitely was a lot like a
bisque. I'd have it again.

Then there was a walk through the lively streets of Melbourne back to
our hotel, and out early the next morning. The SkyBus (somehow there
is no train) was 20 minutes on Sunday morning and like 40 minutes on
Saturday afternoon. We changed our AKL-WLG flight and got back to Wellington
in the early afternoon.

## Travel planning

I signed up for the IJF Academy practical session in Japan and started occasional nage-no-kata practice. I also got tickets for the trip to the Ontario Open/SPLASH/Manitoba Open (WLG-YVR, YVR-YYZ, YYZ-LAX, LAX-YWG, YWG-WLG). I should arrange accomodation for that and for the North Island Championships. I'm ditching the South Islands in Christchurch in favour of a mountaineering trip to Ruapehu.

# Movement statistics

Includes the Australia trip, which is a lot of flying, relatively, for staying in this part of the world (but Cairns is really far north at 16°S).

* 🚶 Walking: 116km on 22 days (same as June, though only the last day of the Old Ghost Road)
* 🚲 Biking: 65km on 9 days
* 🚗 Driving: 535km on 8 days (almost all in Australia)
* 🚗 Taxi: 95km (off the Old Ghost Road; to WLG, MEL, around Cairns, and to CNS)
* 🚌 Bus: 277km on 7 days (mostly from the Old Ghost Road)
* ✈ Plane: 10941km (NSN-WLG, WLG-MEL, MEL-CNS, CNS-MEL, MEL-AKL-WLG)
* 🚣 Boat: 128km (Great Barrier Reef)
* 🚠 Gondola: 8.5km (Kurunda SkyRail)
* 🚆 Train: 69km (Upper Hutt and Australia)

Pretty average month apart from getting to Cairns. More time on boats this year than usual.

## Walks

* [Old Ghost Road](https://oldghostroad.org.nz/): last day
* Melbourne: [Happy Valley Track](https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/long-forest-flora-and-fauna-reserve/things-to-do/walking-in-long-forest); a lyrebird walk, but not quite [this one](https://walkingmaps.com.au/walk/4497) in Sherbrooke Forest
* Kurunda Village to Barron Falls round-trip 8.7km
* Atherton Highlands: Hypipamee Track and Wongabel State Forest

Australian walks are not as well documented as NZ walks on DOC land!

# Pictures

* [July photos report](/post/20240801-july-photos)

This month I processed pictures just up to the end of the month. Marginally fewer
pictures processed than in [June](/post/20240703-june-photos), but I think I took the same number of pictures as I
processed, so just treading water here. The number of sets doesn't tell the whole story,
since sets have different numbers of pictures. New sets is 11.

[Picture
logs](https://www.github.com/patricklam/picture-processing-logs) again
available. As always, pictures are clickable to go to the full gallery. 

* Sets of pictures posted: 20
* Total pictures posted: 648
* Total pictures in selection pool: 1828
* Accept rate: 35% (min 16%, max 68%)

As always, pictures here (and sometimes elsewhere) are clickable to go to the full gallery.

# July posts

Overland Track parts 5 and 6 posted in July:
* [Part 1: Australia versus New Zealand](/post/20240511-overland-track-australia-vs-new-zealand)
* [Part 2: Before the walk](/post/20240616-overland-track-before-the-walk) [[Melbourne photos](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1881), [Hobart](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1891), [Launceston](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1880)]
* [Part 3: Overland Track day 1, Cradle Mountain](/post/20240617-overland-track-cradle-mountain) [[photos](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1884)]
* [Part 4: Overland Track day 2, Windermere](/post/20240624-overland-track-windermere) [[photos](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1879)]
* [Part 5: Overland Track day 3, Pelion](/post/20240718-overland-track-pelion) [[photos](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1875)]
* [Part 6: Overland Track day 4, Kia Ora](/post/20240728-overland-track-kia-ora) [[photos](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1906)]

Two more days left for the Overland Track. No other posts this month. It feels like I've been putting more effort into editing photos than writing (non-summary posts and not research).

# Miscellaneous

Another significant trip this month, but still decent routine.

## Acquisitions

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20240814-july/purchases" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Futuras and MP's new mountaineering boots.</figcaption>
</figure>

* [La Sportiva Futuras](https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/reviews/climbing/climbing-shoes/la-sportiva-futura): my Miura VSs have a hole in them, and these were on sale at Bogong. So were Miuras, but I figured these would be better.

I also had to warranty my headlamp charger. It supposedly is replaced now.

## Sports

Judo practice 7x, missing a week due to Australia trip. Climbing 6× as well. Route difficulty at Faultline seems to fluctuate.

## Restaurants

A few new places in Wellington, plus Australia and Nelson.

### New Zealand


<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20240814-july/food" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Nelson: pizza from Stefano's; seafood chowder from Lambretta's; Penguino ice cream. Upper Hutt: Nora Kebab. Wellington: KC Cafe eggplant, Aurora tart, Library millefeuille, Volco donut, Wraps and Rolls banh mi; Ohakune: Mountain Kebab & eclair.</figcaption>
</figure>

Nelson:
* [Stefano's](https://www.stefanos.co.nz/) ("Real Italian Pizza made by Real Italians"): right next to where the bus dropped us off, and reasonably good.
* [Lambretta's Cafe & Bar](https://www.lambrettascafe.co.nz/): would order the chowder again; different from a sandwich, which I didn't feel like.
* [Penguino Ice Cream Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/PenguinoIceCreamCafe/): ice cream was good (well, duh); stroopwaffle was OK

Greater Wellington:
* [Nora Kebab](https://www.norakebab.com/): I would go here more often if it wasn't all the way at the end of the train line.
* [KC Cafe](https://www.kccafeandtakeaway.co.nz/): somewhat famous in Wellington, but the eggplant dish was actually kind of weird and maybe I'll try something more usual next time.
* [Cream Cake Studio](https://www.instagram.com/creamcakestudio/): I had something small and tasty from there but I guess I didn't take a photo and forgot what.
* [Library](https://www.thelibrary.co.nz/): again, not the millefeuille I was expecting, though I'm always a fan of whipped cream.
* [Volco Dough Club](https://www.instagram.com/volcodoughclub/): a donut, again filled with cream, win
* [Wraps and Rolls](https://www.facebook.com/wrapsandrollsnz/): filling was good, bread wasn't my favourite, not crispy

Ohakune:
* [Johnny Nation's Chocolate Eclair Shop](https://www.facebook.com/johnnynationschocolateeclairshop/): famous eclairs deserve their fame (again, cream-filled).
* [Mountain Kebabs](https://www.facebook.com/MountainkebabsOhakune/): lunch stop on the way to Whakapapa, good option. They have kebabs and not much else.

### Australia

<figure>

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Ham and cheese croissant from airport (QuikShots?); Melton: Noodles at Dumpling Lane; Belgrave: tempura eggplant at Mama Yama; ice cream plus boba plus mango at Meat and Dumpling; near airport: beef haleem at Karachi Street Food; central Melbourne: matcha crown croissant at Bing Chillin, lobster bisque ramen at Snow Monkey.</figcaption>
</figure>

Greater Melbourne:
* airport croissant: surprisingly not bad.
* Dumpling Lane (Melton): pretty good for a place inside a mall
* [Mama Yama Sushi Express](http://www.mfsushiexpress.com/): tempura eggplant was light and crispy
* [Meat And Dumpling](https://www.instagram.com/meatndumpling/): at first the heating wasn't on yet and it was cold, so we went to Mama Yama; after lunch we went back and MP had the boba with soft serve, a revelation.
* [Karachi Street Food](https://karachistreetfood.com/): MP's biryani was great. Beef Haleem kind of purée-like.
* [Bing Chillin](https://www.bingchillin.com.au/): Matcha crown croissant was a lot (of taste, sugar, fat, ...).
* [Snow Monkey Ramen](https://snowmonkeyramen.com/): A bunch of creative takes on ramen. I've never had lobster bisque ramen, but it is bisque like and also ramen-like.

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20240814-july/food-australia" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Cairns: burger at Ozmosis; pho at Viet Fresh Noodles; Sushi Train North Cairns; Kuranda: sesame miso soup with tofu from Hayabusa; more mango icecream; Cairns: eggplant from Yama Zuru; Atherton: tasty scone at Lake Barrine Teahouse and Panang Beef in Atherton; Cairns: Jamil's Special Kofta at The MED; SYD: quesadilla, best food in the terminal.</figcaption>
</figure>

Cairns:
* [Ozmosis](https://ozmosiskitchen.com.au/): delicious burger; MP liked her salad too; generous serving size
* [Viet Fresh noodles](https://www.facebook.com/p/Viet-Fresh-noodles-100054250730805/): pretty authentic Vietnamese place
* [Sushi Train North Cairns](https://www.sushitrain.com.au/): a chain; the things we ordered were OK, but there wasn't a lot of choice. Still, not much chicken sushi.
* [Yama Zuru Izakaya](http://www.yamazaru.com.au/): a far better choice than Sushi Train even if sushi was unavailable.

Kurunda:
* [Hayabusa of Kurunda](https://www.facebook.com/hayabusaofkuranda/): haven't seen sesame miso soup like this before, but tasty; can also buy kimonos

Atherton:
* [Lake Barrine Teahouse](https://lakebarrine.com.au/): the scone gets MP's full stamp of approval
* [Northern Star Thai Restaurant](https://www.facebook.com/northernstarthai/): amazing, kind of remotely located

Cairns again:
* [The MED](https://themedstreetfood.com.au/): worth the struggle to find parking on a Friday night, though somehow the place wasn't busy&mdash; it should be!

SYD:
* [Mad Mex](https://www.madmex.com.au/): the best place I could eat at the airport?

## Volunteering/Advocacy

The usual volunteering. I did write in to the NZ Government
consultation on re-increasing the speed limits, which is a terrible
idea. Also I volunteered to help organize MP's Snowcraft course run
through the Wellington Section of NZAC, i.e. making sure that meals
happened ([[pictures](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1932)]; [[day 0](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1934)]; [[day 1](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1933)]).

# Conclusion

Cairns was interesting, though somewhat annoying for reasons I didn't go into
much in the trip report. Plus the Old Ghost Road. Plus a workshop paper.
Can't complain.
