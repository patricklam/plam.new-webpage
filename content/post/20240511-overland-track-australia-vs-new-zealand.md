For another change of pace, we went to Tasmania and hiked the [Overland Track](https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/cradle-mountain/overland-track) over 6 days. The scenery is outstanding and we were lucky to get a high pressure system giving us 6 days of blue skies in May. Let's talk about overall impressions here, and then about a day-by-day recap in the next post.

Many people have, I'm sure, talked about the cultural differences between these countries. (I'm not familiar with that literature). Some of my friends don't quite realize that they're not the same country. Anyway, the focus of this post is on the differences in the tracks, facilities, and users of Tasmania's [Parks & Wildlife Service](https://parks.tas.gov.au) and New Zealand's [Department of Conservation](https://www.doc.govt.nz).

"[Great Walks of Australia](https://greatwalksofaustralia.com.au/)" are a set of 12 guided walks. The Overland Track has a guided Great Walk version called the [Cradle Mountain Signature Walk](https://greatwalksofaustralia.com.au/our-walks/cradle-mountain/) but we didn't do that version. There are also guided versions of some of the [New Zealand Great Walks](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/things-to-do/walking-and-tramping/great-walks/) (in particular the [Milford Track](https://www.ultimatehikes.co.nz/multi-day-guided-walks/milford-track) and also the [Routeburn](https://www.ultimatehikes.co.nz/multi-day-guided-walks/routeburn-track/)), but they are often done independently.

Looking through the archives, I have trip reports from the Heaphy and the Whanganui Journey.

# People

Of course, in 2020, the NZ tracks were mostly full of New
Zealanders. Now it's a pretty international crowd; I'd say from a
quarter to half, at least, of people who don't live in NZ
(e.g. Americans on holiday, even for the less-popular tracks). For the
Overland Track, we were the only people who didn't live in
Australia. A lot of people came from Melbourne. There was another
Montrealer who was finishing a working holiday in Australia.

Are Australians friendlier to strangers than New Zealanders? MP
thought so. I thought that they talked more; it felt harder to get a
word in. Maybe NZers are less talkative.

The thing about both the Great Walks and the Overland Tracks is that
the capacity is actually quite limited. During the booking season, the
Overland doesn't allow day hikers at all (except at the edges, and one
is allowed to walk in to Kia Ora from the side). The Great Walks have
sections with more people (particularly the [Tongariro Northern
Circuit](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/central-north-island/places/tongariro-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/tongariro-northern-circuit/)
in its intersection with the [Alpine
Crossing](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/central-north-island/places/tongariro-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/tongariro-alpine-crossing/)),
but overnight capacity is similarly limited. On the Overland, it's
mostly the 39 people who start with you, plus or minus some
fast-walking and slow-walking additions and subtractions.

# Infrastructure

The Overland Track has 6 main huts for overnight stays on its spine:
[Waterfall
Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_Valley_Hut) (2020) ([ABC article about construction](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-06/tasmanian-trekking-overland-track-huts-australian-tourism/12234154)); [Windermere Hut](https://www.greendesign.net.au/projects/windermere-hut) (2022); [New Pelion Hut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Pelion_Hut) (2001); [Kia Ora Hut](https://www.greendesign.net.au/projects/kia-ora-hut) (2022); Bert Nichols Hut (2008); and the [Narcissus Hut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_Hut) (2015). None of these huts were the first huts on the sites, as the Overland Track has been around since 1931 in one form or another. Hut literature includes early trip reports.

</figure>

The Overland Track huts built in the 2020s are as modern as the new NZ Great Walk huts, e.g. the [Luxmore Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/fiordland/places/fiordland-national-park/things-to-do/huts/luxmore-hut/) (sometime in the 2000s) on the Kepler or the [Moonlight Tops](https://tramping.net.nz/huts-coast/moonlight-tops-hut-paparoa-track-great-walk) on the Paparoa (2019). The most modern huts now have solar lighting. NZ "serviced"-category and Great Walk huts have some heating facility (a wood stove or coal, typically). The Overland Track huts should have had heating, but the heaters were almost all broken for various reasons (e.g. mouse infestations). I've seen a Great Walk hut with charging facilities (and a hut with a fake power outlet). There was no charging on the Overland, though a lot of people had solar chargers.

In terms of the actual sleeping, the sleeping facilities were somewhat
or very separated from the cooking/social space (sometimes by a
breezeway), as happens everywhere. Whanganui Journey also had a
breezeway between the bedrooms and kitchen at Tīeke Marae/Kāinga,
though not at John Coull. Also, New Zealand huts come with mattresses,
while Overland Track did not. Advantage: harder to collect bedbugs;
disadvantage: some people have crinkly air mattresses, which some people find rage-inducing (not me).

</figure>

One is supposed to carry a tent on the Overland Track. We never got
ours out, but many did. There are copious wooden tent platforms and
one would have a quieter night, but then drying the tent the next day
requires more mucking around. The only night where a tent would have helped
me was at [Kia Ora Hut](https://parks.tas.gov.au/be-involved/have-your-say/kia-ora-hut-and-toilet-replacements), where it was too hot (ironically, unlike NZ
housing, which is rarely warm and dry). The next night at Bert Nichols
was more crowded but chilly enough to sleep well.

The Overland Track huts never come with plumbing inside; there are
rainwater tanks outside, along with a sink and grease trap. NZ huts
typically have the rainwater tank and sink plumbed to the inside.

Some NZ Great Walk huts have toilets that are almost attached to the
huts. On the Overland it is a bit more of a walk, though it is on
boardwalk. The toilets on the Overland are super flash and come with
their own rainwater tanks. Probably in all of these places the waste
is helicoptered out; there were signs to that effect on the Overland.

NZ huts also typically have more reading material left around ([Wilderness](https://www.wildernessmag.co.nz/)
magazine, Federated Mountain Club's [Backcountry](https://fmc.org.nz/what-we-do/publications/aboutbackcountry/) Magazine). I only saw
hut books (for hikers' thoughts, historical information, and Intentions books)
in the Tasmanian huts.

We saw rangers twice on this trip. In peak season on the more popular
Great Walks the huts are staffed, but we've also been to plenty of
Great Walks where we saw no staff (e.g. Heaphy in July). The Overland
doesn't have hut talks.

# The Track

There is a lot of boardwalk on the Overland Track (like Hump
Ridge). It's easy to move fast on boardwalk. However, day 3 from Lake
Windermere to New Pelion Hut had a super muddy part in the middle, up
to Frog Flats. It would have been terrible to trudge through the mud
underneath the boardwalk, and I wonder how the 1931 walkers coped with
significantly more mud (but less traffic to make mud). The muddy part
was about as muddy as
[Rakiura](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/southland/places/stewart-island-rakiura/rakiura-national-park/things-to-do/rakiura-track/)
or [Hump
Ridge](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/fiordland/places/fiordland-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/hump-ridge-track/),
or maybe worse. Rakiura, on Stewart Island, is probably the muddiest
of NZ Great Walks, due to location (and the [North West
Circuit](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/southland/places/stewart-island-rakiura/rakiura-national-park/things-to-do/north-west-circuit-stewart-island-rakiura/)
is, I've heard, a lot worse).

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Boardwalks; some mud in the forest; cross the swamp!</figcaption>
</figure>

Aside from that muddy section, the Overland Track was highly
maintained. NZ Great Walk
[standard](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/things-to-do/walking-and-tramping/track-categories/)
is supposed to be intermediate, harder than a walking track and easier
than a tramping track. The Overland's side trips had some scrambling
near the summits; those would be impossible in icy conditions. (We've
also walked in the Blue Mountains near Sydney and some of those trails
were extremely built-up with lots of paving stones.)

There are lots of trail markers. Unlike in New Zealand, the trail
markers are heterogeneous. There are some orange blazes like those in
NZ, but also white fabric patches and posts with rings. Of course NZ
track markers are in DOC green, while the Australian markers were
either on wooden boards or blue.

The material from the Tasmanian Parks Service talks up the difficulty
of the Overland Track (and says it's a "life-changing
experience"). The core route itself is quite modest, at 66km over 6
days, though still enough to give some walkers a challenge. The base
route has two 3 hour days.  Some of the people walking with us did all
of the side trips (Cradle Mountain, Barn Bluff, Mount Oakleigh, Mount
Ossa, Pelion West, all of the falls, and around Lake St. Clair). That
makes it a lot harder and none of the days are 3 hour days with those
extensions. We did Credle, Ossa, Pelion West, and the 3 falls.

</figure>

The Overland Track is one-way during the bookable season, like the
Milford Track, to prevent congestion at the huts. The other NZ Great
Walks have no rules, though it would be quite hard to paddle upstream
on the Whanganui. The Overland does not require walkers to book
specific huts, while Great Walks do.

# The Scenery

The Overland is more days (6) than any Great Walk (max 4), so it has
more of a chance to be varied, but even so, I would say that there is
indeed more variety in a single walk than any NZ Great Walk: alpine,
swamp, buttongrass, etc. We got great weather and enjoyed the scenery
immensely. The collection of NZ Great Walks has more variety, of course,
including volcanic terrain and a canoe trip (both absent from Overland).

Tasmania has terrestrial mammals and New Zealand isn't supposed to (except for bats). We've seen
mice at both.  I don't think we've actually seen possums on Great
Walks in New Zealand but did see them on the Overland, as well as
wallabies, wombats, and a broad-tooth mouse. At first, the wombat looked like a rock, but it was furry, and it moved. Rocks don't move. We did see bats on the Whanganui Journey.

New Zealand has the New Zealand birds, including kea and kiwi, which
I've both seen on Great Walks. On the other hand, MP saw some yellow-tailed
black cockatoo and we both saw the Tasmanian green rosella and yellow wattlebird.

</figure>

Glaciers were ubiquitous in the world, including New Zealand and Tasmania.
But many formations in Cradle Mountain were above the historical glaciation level
("nunataks"). To my knowledge, New Zealand doesn't have any of those. We saw some glacial
cirques at Cradle Mountain, I think (e.g. Forth Valley) but there are more of them in
Tasmania. We didn't see any actual snow, but it does happen on this track; there
are reports of it over Christmas. New Zealand Great Walks can very much have snow,
and avalanches.

# Big Bonus

In general, people are concerned about the dangerous animals of Australia.
Tasmania does have some snakes but is mostly free of these animals. One animal that
is in New Zealand but not Tasmania, at least in May, is the sandfly. Hurrah! That part
was amazing.
