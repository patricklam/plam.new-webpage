For MP's first trip abroad since the pandemic started, we agreed that
Japan for Reading Week would be the ticket. Halfway between, so only
12 hours for both of us. (Well, a bit more than that on the way there
and less on the way back; but way less than 24). We'd been to Japan in
2005 and MP had been twice more after that, in 2008 and 2012, to visit her friend who was
living there at the time.

# Pre-trip planning

Once we decided to go to Japan, there was a potential analysis paralysis problem.
So many things we could do, but which? We spent two days in December and January at the
quite prescriptive Wānaka library and at the New Plymouth library, and consulted a bunch
of guidebooks there. Our early-2000s Lonely Planet guide was in Waterloo and we weren't.

We then built the spine of the trip around walking a bit of the Nakasendō,
an ancient road linking Edō (Tōkyō) and Kyōto. As I understand it, the
Tokugawa-era "[alternate attendance](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-was-japans-alternate-attendance-system-195289)" policy reinforced shogunal control by forcing
feudal lords to go live in the de facto capital Edō every other year, and their wives and first-born sons to live in
there all the time. (More money spent on real estate and travel is less money spent on raising armies!) We wouldn't have time to do all the 300km of the road,
but we could do a bit more than the 8km tourist highlight from Magome to Tsumago. I'd
originally planned two full days, but shortened that to one
day and one hour.

</figure>

The other anchor destination of the trip was Hokkaidō. This wasn't a ski
trip and I wouldn't have time for significant skiing (2h from Sapporo), but I could
get in a half day near Sapporo. And I figured that we could see
the tanchō, or red-crowned cranes, if we could get to Kushiro.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Tanchos (red-crowned cranes) near Kushiro (Hokkaido).</figcaption>
</figure>

MP wanted to see the cherry blossoms, so we added early cherry
blossoms in Miurakaigan just at the beginning. And, between the
Nakasendō and Hokkaido, we would have one night in Takayama, two
nights in Kanazawa (a luxury&mdash;two nights in one place is hardly slow travel, but still much more restful than
being constantly on the move), and a stop in Matsumoto to see the
castle. The goal would be to see historic districts and castles, which are
generally not a thing in New Zealand. (Dunedin tries, but it's not that historic).
And any birds I could see.

# Day 0: Arrival in Japan, February 17

We'd gotten flights that were both supposed to arrive around 5pm local
time; MP had 10h55 of flying from Auckland and arrived 15 minutes
late, at 5:05pm, while my flight info says I arrived at 5:07pm and I
was off the plane at 5:20. (The Air Canada flight is often late by an
hour, but mine was only 10 minutes late). Somehow MP managed to clear
customs enough before me that I didn't see her in line, even
retrieving her checked luggage. I had no checked luggage and got past
luggage claim by 5:56pm.

Anyway, the plan was to position ourselves on the first night so that
we could see the early cherry blossoms in Miurakaigen early the next
day, so we got a hotel room in Yokosuka: 2 more hours of train from
Narita, but then only 30 minutes (the next day) to the cherry
blossoms. Of those 2 hours on the train, 1 was to Shinagawa on the
Narita Express and then the other hour was on the local Keikyu Main
Line: basically a commuter rail.

The Mercure Yokosuka had staff with excellent English, likely as a
result of being close to the US Navy base.  The hotel wasn't super
cheap at C$128, but it was only a 10 minute walk from the station and
comfortable for our first night in Japan. We got some snacks at the
convenience store at the Yokosuka train station and called it a night,
checking in to the Mercure at 9pm.

## Logistics digression: transport, comms, and money

We'd ordered 7-day Japan Rail Passes for a 9 day trip, so the pass
would only start on day 1, and we paid ¥8740 cash (well, via credit
card) for passage for two to Yokosuka. This would be much less than
the ¥9900 per person for Sapporo to Kushiro we'd planned for day
7. (In the event, the last-minute Kanazawa to Sapporo train trip would
also have been super expensive, but we didn't have to pay, since we
had our rail passes). And the other bonus of exchanging the voucher
for a pass at Yokohama on the next day was that we avoided the lineups on arrival at Narita.
We had paid about ¥31500 for each pass.

The other logistics things we'd need were: 1) I'd ordered two
unlimited 8 day data cellphone SIMs from Mobal for ¥4000 and had them
shipped to the Yokosuka hotel (I should have staggered the validity
periods); and 2) I had planned to withdraw money using my Wise
card. So we didn't have data between leaving the airport (except for a
brief bit on the Narita Express where it worked&mdash;usually it
doesn't) and getting to the hotel.  I got to a convenience store at
Yokosuka station and tried to withdraw money, but that didn't work. A
few days later I noticed that I had to enable the "allow ATM
withdrawals" button for my card on my Wise account.

At the beginning of the trip I had forgotten where I'd put my Wise
card, and at the end of the trip I had forgotten where I'd put my keys. Oops.
Fortunately I found both these things.

# Day 1: Miura Kaigan early cherry blossoms, February 18

The train from Yokosuka to Miura Kaigen was again on the non-JR Keikyu Main
Line so the JR Pass wouldn't have helped anyway, and it was
pretty cheap at ¥250. I had planned a very ambitious 7:23 train from 
Yokosuka; we actually got to the train station by 7:52 and onto the
8:30 train to Miura Kaigen.

Stepping off the train about half an hour later, it felt like spring,
and was a warm, sunny day, at about 14°C. We were maybe a week early
for peak early blossoms at Miura Kaigen. Hordes of people came
later, as we were leaving, around 11. We noticed traffic guards with
pink vests, presumably to match the blossoms, and signage for drivers
about not hitting people.

There were some vendors who had set up at the train station, and then
more vendors of tasty food at the main place, Komatsogaike Park.
The street food was actually kind of pricey compared to other food in Japan,
though not in absolute terms: ¥700 for meat on a stick.

I managed to see [6 bird species](https://ebird.org/checklist/S128630202);
most of the Japanese birds are new to me. The warbling white-eye
is a lot like the New Zealand silvereye, and they are indeed related.
The white-eye is easier to spot in leaf-less trees, though. I have few
silvereye pictures.

## Onward to Nakatsugawa

We took the Keikyu line back to Yokohama and then got (with no waiting in line) our
JR passes and seat reservations for our first shinkansen segment
(270kph) on this trip, Shin-Yokohama to Nagoya, bookended by two
regular (Rapid to Shin-Yokohama, and Limited Express from Nagoya) trains.

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20230226-japan-part-i/shinkansen-speed" >}}
</figure>

Leaving Yokohama it did start to get cloudy, and it rained on us in
Nakatsugawa, where we stepped out of our lodging to get dinner at a
nearby yakuniku (grilled meats) place, [Suzuya](http://nakatugawa.info/suzuya/). Pictures on the tablet menus
and Google Lens were useful for ordering. We successfully
ordered tasty food. They had actually brought us upstairs where there
were vents above the grills; upstairs also was a big plus in that the
downstairs was full of cigarette smoke, but the upstairs was not at
all. Weird thing about Japan is that smoking in bars can be OK but not on the streets of Shinjuku in Tokyo.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Topiary, Nakatsugawa station, and cooking food over flames at a yakuniku place.</figcaption>
</figure>

We stayed at the [Ryokan O](https://the-ryokan-o.com/), which is not really
a ryokan, but does have sleeping on futons on tatamis and shared bathrooms. It was quite
economical (C$74) and totally fine. We were at many places with shared bathrooms
in Japan, and I don't really have a problem with that. Sure, slightly less convenient, but also cheaper.
I'll do that.

# Day 2: Nakasendō (Nakatsugawa to Otsumago), February 19

The main active part of this trip was walking a small part of the ancient
Nakasendō, which connected Edo (Tokyo) to Kyōto. We'd walk 16km, basically from the Nakatsugawa train station to the Nagiso train station, through some moderate mountain passes, with a stop at a minshuku outside Tsumago.

I did *not* want to bring my stuff with me on the hike. It was
forecast to rain and we had 2 backpacks each. Maybe packing lighter
was possible, but I also had a bunch of winter clothes with me, which
I did not regret having at all. I'd heard about [luggage delivery](https://www.global-yamato.com/en/hands-free-travel/scene02.html),
and we managed to get our 2 bags sent ahead to arrive next-day
(between 4pm and 6pm) at Takayama for ¥3200. (Same-day seems mostly
unavailable). We had some trouble communicating with the hotel staff
at the Ryokan O about the forwarding, and it's a bit of a leap of
faith to expect that one's bags will arrive, but ours did.

We also had to arrive at our minshuku Kameyama by 5pm or the owner
would worry about us arriving in the dark.  So we left at 7:40 and
stopped by 7-11 (way better than in North America) to get some
provisions for breakfast. There was also a brother and sister (brother
lives in Japan, sister in Ireland) at the lodging who we saw again at the 7-11; 
they had done it yesterday, and thought it was great, though they regretted
that we'd be doing it in the rain.

## Digression: The Great Japanese Novel
I'd also started to read [Before the
Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_the_Dawn_(novel)) by Tōson
Shimazaki before leaving on the trip, though I didn't have time to get
through much of it pre-trip (I would have liked to borrow it a bit
earlier than I did, but I wanted to finish my COVID
isolation before going to the library). I did not want to lug an extra kilogram of paper, so I
continued reading an [ebook
version](https://archive.org/details/beforedawn00shim_0) courtesy of
the Internet Archive. Reading the book gives some more context on the
places that I walked through.  Then we ordered tea-over-rice in
Takayama, which was one of the foods mentioned in the book.  Also
mentioned was eating 30 thrushes. I saw lots of thrushes but can't
really imagine eating them.

## Walking: Nakatsugawa to Magome

We really liked this part of the walk. It's mostly on pavement, and
someone on the Internet had rated it as "easy". There's still more
than 0 elevation gain, though. It's not hard, but it's not a
cakewalk. It is very doable though.

We set out from the Nakatsugawa honjin (lodging for daimyos) at 8:15
and walked past lots of shrines and some parks. There were certainly
historical-looking buildings even on this part of the way, and some
modern houses and hotels too. Japan, like NZ and unlike Canada, has
lots of public toilets.

{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20230226-japan-part-i/nakasendo-sign" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">One of many types of Nakasendo signs.</figcaption>
</figure>

We got to looking for Nakasendō trail signs. There were enough
of them to make navigation pretty easy. GPS isn't great in terms
of telling you where the trail is (or our map data anyway).

There was a horde of fast walking older Japanese people. They meant business.
We were slightly faster than them, but whenever I stopped to take pictures, they
would catch up to me. I was taking waterfall pictures and then got stuck in the horde.
"Sumimasen!" (excuse me!) and they let me pass. They were not taking pictures.
They had lots of rain gear.

Speaking of the rain, it was a bit wet, but really did interfere with taking pictures.
Wet lenses are not great. I tried to alternate between the mirrorless camera, the point and shoot,
and the phone, trying to find a lens that was dry enough.

## Magome

* [Gallery](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1660)

This town was the centre of attention in _Before the Dawn_ and is now
a restored historic village. In the right season, it seems like it
would have tons of tour buses. There were people there in February,
but not hordes. We got there at 11, well ahead of schedule for
arriving in Otsumago by 5.

Magome is a tourist spot in 2023 and so there are things like souvenir
shops (stuff made in China) and ATMs and free wifi hotspots. Also
Pokemon Go stuff. But all the buildings do have an Edo-era look, as
far as I can tell.

Souvenir shops do have the advantage that the rain isn't falling on
one's head, at least. Eating lunch in a restaurant shares this advantage.

The historic-looking main street goes up a slope. There are lots of
water wheels everywhere on the Nakasendō, but Magome has a bunch of them. Makes sense
with the topography and the water.

Lunch was at a decent udon shop. We tried two other places that were
supposed to be open but weren't.  Also got the chestnuts on rice,
which are supposed to be a Nakatsugawa special. They're fine.

## Walking: Magome to Otsumago

The last part of our walk on this day was to our lodging, Kameyama,
which was 20 minutes before Tsumago. On the map it's in Otsumago. The
Magome to Tsumago segment is the most famous Nakasendo segment. It's
certainly a well-preserved walk in the woods, i.e. a semi-wilderness experience.
(There is an on-road detour, presumably due to a slip). 
There is moderate
elevation gain reaching a high of 790m; when we were there, it was
enough to see a bit of snow on the ground, but we were never in the snow and we didn't require
traction aids (yaktrax). All the houses had shovels though! I feel like I could have used the yaktrax in Sapporo much more than
on the trail.


It did rain on us pretty heavily especially at the start, but it
wasn't cold (latitude 35°N); I think it was around 10° that day. The
[Tateba
teahouse](https://www.mustlovejapan.com/subject/tateba_tea_house/) was
most welcome.

The trail detour takes us right past the Otaki metaki (male and
female) waterfalls. I guess what's special about these falls is that
there are two falls right next to each other. Normally it takes a side
trip to see them. In general there was a decent number of waterfalls,
some artificial.  Not as many as on a NZ tramp, though.

</figure>

Finding a place to stay in Tsumago had actually been a mission. Many
places were either not open in February, or full. In the end, we called
the Tourist Information office in Tsumago and they managed to book
Kameyama for us, which is technically a minshuku; it seems to be a
one-woman show and basically a guest suite, with a bath. The owner was
really concerned that we might be stuck out after dark, but we managed
to arrive around 3. I had a chance to read _Before the Dawn_ in the place
it was about, though on my phone, and also other things.

Dinner and breakfast were tasty, including,
in particular, grilled fish. There was an ofuro (bath), which seems to help my ankle after the walk.
Of course, we had to do yukata pictures.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Bedroom; me in yukuta; MP at dinner; fireplace; Kameyama; fog atop Tsumago; breakfast.</figcaption>
</figure>

(Why the fish weight over the fireplace? I read elsewhere that there was symbolic value
in putting a water creature over the fire. You know, the thing that could burn the wooden
house down. Fireplaces in other parts of Japan didn't have metal fish.)

# Day 3 part 1: Nakasendo (Otsumago to Nagiso), February 20

I was glad that we had requested an 8:00 breakfast; the Kameyama
owner has to get up earlier to prepare it. With an 8:00 breakfast, we'd
be out of her way before too late, but not require her to be up too early.
There was either a bus at 9:33 from Tsumago or a 3km walk, and we'd aim for the
11:00 train to Matsumoto. We opted for the walk.

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20230226-japan-part-i/morning-otsumago-walk" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Luggage forwarding; fish farm; hanging laundry.</figcaption>
</figure>

But first, I thought I'd try to get some sunrise pictures. This is
always challenging for me. Jetlag helps a bit, but it's still
early. Kameyama is a bit up a hill, good for pictures. There
was low-lying fog and a couple of birds, though for the early
morning walk I only brought the 16-50 and 35mm lenses. I managed to
photograph a dusky thrush and got a picture of couple of fish in the fish
farm (the source of the grilled fish, perhaps?) Not much
of a sunrise though.

We left at 8:49 and got to Tsumago at 9:17. Then we took as long as we
wanted to admiring the historical-looking buildings and shrines. We
even went up to the Tsumago viewpoint (old castle) 5 minutes uphill
after leaving town, reaching the top at 10:18. There were a couple of
rural houses and people doing their thing, e.g.  drying their laundry
(kids' judogis?). There is a bus from Tsumago to Nagiso but it doesn't run very often.
We instead walked, and made it to Nagiso by 10:55 and caught the 11:00
train to Matsumoto (next post!).

</figure>

## Magome versus Tsumago

Magome's way bigger (and it's the centre of the action in _Before the
Dawn_).  It had at least 2 museums which we didn't visit, and
definitely more souvenir shops and restaurants were open when we were
in Magome (midday) than Tsumago (early).  Also Tōson's grave is in
Magome, though I couldn't find the specific stone (and I tried to read
the inscriptions with Google Lens!)

There were a couple of houses that were restored to Meiji-era looks,
though we would later see a lot more old houses in Takayama's Hida
Folk Village. Magome and Tsumago old houses were in their original
locations, though, unlike Hida's transplanted houses.  Anyway, since
we were staying 20 minutes out of Tsumago proper, and it was rainy, we
didn't get golden hour photos of these old post towns (and we were
drying out on the way in). Still, pretty good.

# Sneak preview of part 2

Next up! We go see more historic districts and castles, and then up to
Hokkaido for mellow nature. Well, maybe the double black diamond at
Sapporo Teine that I did 5 times isn't quite so mellow, but the snow
was super soft.
