Following up on last week's tip, here's a near-data-disaster from <a

So, yes, it's not just hardware failure or loss, it can also be a
problem between chair and keyboard.

We'll keep this week's tip short. Here's a picture from near the <a
href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/wellington-kapiti/places/tararua-forest-park/things-to-do/huts/kime-hut/">Kime
Hut</a> in the Tararua Forest Park about 86km from Wellington. It's
about 5-6 hours of walking from the trailhead (11.5km and 1476m of
elevation gain, if you care).

* Tip: After you climb up the mountain, you also have to descend!

Usually it's not best practice to count on helicopters (or giant
eagles if you're Frodo and Sam) to quickly evacuate you from the
summit. People get injured more often on the descent when they're
tired and it's getting dark---that nice sunset photo means that the
sun will set soon and then it will be dark. Plan on descent time in
your trip plans. (In our case we stayed at the hut and walked out the
next day in the mist.)

Mountaineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Viesturs">Ed Viesturs</a> said it before me: "Getting to the top is
optional, getting back down is mandatory. A lot of people forget about
that."
