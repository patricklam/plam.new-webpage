If you think I didn't process many photos in December, try January! Between teaching 3 courses and 3 trips, I really didn't have much time. But, we're now at the 4-day hike in January 2023, and then the next real set I have is August 2023. There is also a ski trip that I should write a trip report for, maybe.

Processed 7 sets and added 3 (and a couple more stranded pictures that I should pull off devices).

[Picture

available. As always, pictures are clickable to go to the full gallery.

# Final pictures from South Island Adventures (Gillepsie Circuit, December 2022)

Whew, that's it for pictures from this epic trip and the major hike which was part of the trip. Crucible
Lake is reputed to be the highlight and it is indeed striking, though you don't see any pictures of the whole
crucible on this page (go to the entire day's gallery).

# Around the Mountain Circuit (January 2023)

Just after coming back from the South Island and just before starting to teach in January 2023 in Waterloo, we had one more trip out to Taranaki to walk the Around the Mountain Circuit. We were in Wellington on December 30, 31, and January 1.

# Doubtful Sound Navigator cruise (May 2024)

Real NZ does two-night Doubtful Sound cruises in May and June when the days are short. I've posted days 1 and 2 earlier, but have finally finished day 3. We had a bit of snow overnight (it is almost winter in May).
