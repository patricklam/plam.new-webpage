New Zealand currently has 10 [Great Walks](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/things-to-do/walking-and-tramping/great-walks/), with [Hump Ridge](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/fiordland/places/fiordland-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/hump-ridge-track/) soon to be
number 11.  One of the Great Walks is not a walk at all: the
[Whanganui Journey](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/manawatu-whanganui/places/whanganui-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/whanganui-journey/) is an 87 or 145km canoe trip from either Whakahoro or
Taumarunui to Pipiriki on the Whanganui River, over 3 or 5 days.

Having paddled the 5-day version of this Journey in April 2024, I now can update that review with our actual experiences on and around the river.

# Getting to Taumarunui (by transit)

* [[Before the Journey photos](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1856)]

No cars, no planes. Buses and trains (and vans) from our place in
Wellington to this adventure. I always find it to be a waste to rent a car
for an adventure and leave it parked all the time (even more than how
cars usually spend vast majority of their time parked).

The [Northern
Explorer](https://www.greatjourneysnz.com/scenic-trains/northern-explorer-train/)
train runs from Wellington to Taumarunui. We wanted to be in Taumarunui for
Friday, March 29, which would have actually worked with the
Friday/Sunday/Wednesday northbound schedule. But, we instead took
the [Capital
Connection](https://www.greatjourneysnz.com/capital-connection/) to
Palmerston North and then the InterCity bus to Taumarunui. I guess I
just wanted to take the Capital Connection. I did not compare prices,
but all of our tickets were not cheap. More than GO Transit for sure.

The Capital Connection was chocka (full) on the day before the Easter
weekend. On the train I wrote feedback to the NZ Government about the
terrible draft Government Policy Statement on transport ("moar
cars"). Getting off at the end of the line in Palmerston North, I saw
a handful of bike commuters who had taken the train. We walked 2km to
the the [Masonic Hotel](https://www.masonichotel.co.nz/home) ("A place
for all ages"), which seemed like it might be a bit dated. The room
was not dated at all and had a toaster, which we used to toast all of
our bagels.

The [Afghan Darbar Restaurant](https://afghandarbarrestaurant.co.nz/)
was a great option. They have doner and kebap, but also Afghan
dumplings and Kabuli Pulao. I had the pulao (not so common
around here) which was tasty, with tender meat.

</figure>


The next morning I found [Alexandre
Patisserie](https://www.facebook.com/AlexandrePatisserieChocolaterie/),
whose Google directions aren't accurate. Croissant was good but not as
good as the best NZ croissant I've had (Le Moulin, Christchurch). Took
sandwiches away for lunch as well. They didn't actually speak French,
even if they greet you with "Bonjour".

The InterCity then took us to the Taumarunui train station by 2. It
being Good Friday, almost everything was closed. We grabbed second lunch and
(takeaway) dinner at [Jasmine's Cafe & Thai
Restaurant](https://www.facebook.com/p/Jasmines-cafe-Thai-restaurant-taumarunui-NZ-100052786193558/). Like
many places in NZ, it was a bit too sweet, but the fried rice was
OK. Could have used some hot sauce, but we didn't have any.

# Taumarunui Canoe Hire

In _Emerald Hours_, the author didn't like the lodging options
in Taumarunui. We stayed outside town and didn't explore those
options at all.

Specifically, [Taumarunui Canoe Hire](https://taumarunuicanoehire.co.nz/) will pick you up in town (in a
van) at 4 and drive you the 3km to their base camp. The distance is
definitely walkable but we decided to stay in Taumarunui for 2 hours instead of walking for
45 minutes.

At the TCH base camp, they have some new portable bunkrooms, whose
mattresses were more comfortable than our inflatable ones, and which
also meant that we didn't have to put away our tents the next morning.

Their base camp also has a cat, a pig, and half a dozen minature poodles
with another 5 poodle puppies in a playpen.

</figure>

Our departure briefing was at 9:30am the next morning, said the info
on our (probably waterproof) barrels. Well, the small 4 barrels were supposedly waterproof;
the large one (for tents) not. I noticed Robert's group of 16
with tons of barrels, also leaving with us on a 5-day trip. We packed
our barrels in the evening so that we wouldn't have to do anything in
the morning. (Breakfast ended up being some bars; no cleaning needed.)

# Day 1: On the river; Taumarunui to Ohinepane to Poukaria, 35km

* [Day 1 photos](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1855)

Turns out that "Robert" was [Rob O'Callahan](https://robert.ocallahan.org/), who I'd last seen at SPLASH 2022 in
Auckland, and had known from way back. He runs these trips with a big crowd and,
in this case, had coincidentally planned the Whanganui River Journey at the same
time as us. We'd be staying at the same places except on the first night, where he
was at Ohinepane and we were 2 hours down the river at Poukaria. We had, however,
managed to get huts for the nights after the first night; easier for 2 than for 16! [[Rob's writeup](https://robert.ocallahan.org/2024/04/whanganui-river-journey.html)]

Since we were both doing 5-day trips, they had us at the same 9:30 briefing,
where they told us about some of the highlights along the river, and some tips about
whether we should go left or right. We just had to remember them for 5 days.

Two hours later, we had been briefed, loaded the canoes,
and had some practice for newbies.  The guy doing the briefing was
concerned about one of the canoe teams, gave them a kayak paddle in case it
would help (it didn't), and correctly predicted that they wouldn't
make it upright through the first rapids, which were just 30 minutes
in.

Except for the 50/50 rapids right at the end on day 5, the first day has the most
challenging rapids throughout the trip. MP and I managed to get
through them all without swimming. There were some spills in Rob's group.

<figure>

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Setting off; canoes; first rapids; arrival at Ohinepane; scouting out the rapids; almost at Poukaria; campsite.</figcaption>
</figure>

Also, we observed a group (different canoe rental company) who had
wrapped one of their canoes around a rock. I didn't even think those
rapids were that big.  But MP was busy rubbernecking and I was like
"stop rubbernecking! paddle so that we also don't wrap around a rock!"
Their canoe didn't look to be in very good shape. Fortunately, they did
it close to a road, said that they were OK, and had called for help.

We saw that group back on the water on day 3; they seemed to make it
to the end from there.

## Birds and scenery

MP had been unconvinced about the scenery on this trip. I think many
of the pictures on the Internet don't do it justice. Maybe some of
mine are nice. Anyway, around the Whanganui, you have ferns, as usual
in New Zealand, and green. Some other parts of New Zealand are a bit
brown now, but not near the river.

There were also heaps of welcome swallows. More than I'd seen anywhere
else.  Sometimes dozens of them flying across the river and hunting
for bugs.  (There were some sandflies, but not that many that were
biting). Occasionally we would also see mallards and gray ducks.

## Ohinepane

Ohinepane is the recommended first overnight stop, 22km from Taumarunui.
I'd initially booked it, but then changed to Poukaria, so that we would have
a shorter day 2. Rob's group stayed here.

There had been some information in the briefing about staying right;
there were allegedly some falls to the left. I tried to scout it out but
didn't see the falls. Anyway, there was a bit more action to the right, but
nothing too big.

## Onwards to Poukaria

We still had another 7km to go. Although the water wasn't very white, there
was wind making our lives harder, and it started to get cold. Probably this was the toughest 2
hours on the trip.

Eventually we got to Poukaria, where there was a group of
5: Claire, Brooke, Carolyn (originally from Canada), Chris, and
Josh. We'd also be paddling with them over the next few days.

Poukaria is somewhat slopey and rated for 20 campers. Even with 7
campers it wasn't that roomy.

# Day 2: Poukaria to Whakahoro, 24km

* [Day 2 photos](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1854)

The extra 7km on day 1 meant a shorter day 2; indeed, we spent just
over 5 hours on the river, with 4 hours moving time. Less rapids, less
wind.  We left around 10 and got to Whakahoro by 2:30 or 3, being the
first ones there. There were fewer swallows, but some shags
(cormorants).

The thing that was least clear was where we should dock. There is a dock on the
Whanagui itself, but there is no space to dock there; it's occupied by a jetboat.
Then, there is a sign for the Retaruke River, and an indication that the access
to the campsite is 400m up that river. We paddled up the Retaruke and found one potential
place to dock. The map indicated another place, further along and under the bridge,
but the water was shallow. So we eventually decided to dock at the first place.

It turns out that there is also a 400m walk with 20m elevation gain
from the tie-up to the campsite/bunkroom. Which isn't that far, but
there are barrels to bring up. The hill features prominently in the
Intentions Book.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Native bush at Pouakaria; the Whanganui River; some falls on the river; Chris, Brooke, and Josh taking a break; calm river.</figcaption>
</figure>

Turns out MP and I were the only ones staying inside the hut (old
schoolhouse). The group of 5 and Rob's group all showed up a bit after
us and camped outside. The hut had power and a heater. The heater
doesn't work but the power does.

Although there wasn't anyone else staying at the campground, various
hunters/mountain bikers (not disjoint groups) showed up at various
times and left on the mountain biking trails.

# Day 3: People show up; Whakahoro to John Coull, 35km

* [Day 3 photos](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1852)

Whakahoro also features the [Blue Duck Station](https://blueduckstation.co.nz/), which serves breakfast
and lunch. Also accommodation, though I don't know how that works.  I
had eggs benedict. Happy to help out local businesses, and a nice
change from the ramen that we had for 3 of the 5 days of our trip. The
whio (blue ducks) certainly aren't on the Whanganui, but the guestbook
at Blue Duck Station records sightings of blue ducks nearby.

</figure>


Many of the shorter trips start on this day, and John Coull Hut ended
up being at capacity. In particular there was a large Asian group. I talked a
bit to the warden, who was a fulltime DOC employee (maintenance) but
volunteers to staff the hut when there is a need. He had done the Te
Aroroa in 2020 just before COVID.

Again there was no wind and great conditions (mostly sunny). We almost capsized
twice when we weren't paying attention, but it's not because the rapids were tricky.
There was just no reason. I managed to keep our balance though.

We were passed twice by river guide Stacey's waka. He also helped rescue one of the other
canoes when they tipped over. They can move faster than us, with 4 paddlers, though we still
usually averaged a faster speed than them (fewer breaks). A pair of German women also showed up
on the river; I thought they were Claire and Brooke, but nope. 

There were noticeably fewer swallows than on the first two days.
Swallows, grey ducks, mallards, and goats. ("MP, there are four goats.") There were more cliffs.

At dusk, we managed to see bats over the trees at the hut, and the
warden found a bat listener, which made clicking noises when the bats
were echolocating. Too hard to photograph, though.

# Day 4: Bridge to Nowhere; John Coull to Tīeke Marae/Kāinga, 33km

* [Day 4 photos](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1851)

An average day, with 32km on the river from Whakahoro to
[Tīeke Marae/Kāinga](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/manawatu-whanganui/places/whanganui-national-park/things-to-do/huts/tieke-kainga/).
There were again good conditions, with few rapids (Class 1 I'd say,
barely more than EV). Sunny and little wind, so we averaged 7km/h.
Unfortunately MP's sunglasses went swimming when I tried to get them
out of the backpack. There were too many things in the top pocket and
they just went flying as I was taking other things out. I think one's best
chance to recover an item is immediately. Otherwise it sinks and there is
too much current to circle around.

Again noticeably fewer swallows than on the previous days, though
sometimes there were bunches. At the hut there were possums and mice,
as well as blackbirds and sparrows.

</figure>


This day is the chance to visit the [Bridge to Nowhere](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/manawatu-whanganui/places/whanganui-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/bridge-to-nowhere-walk/), which is
otherwise accessible by mountain bike or by jetboat. We were perplexed
by the jetboat operations. There were two boats that looked like they were
trying to dock. One did. The other boat hung around for a while and then
just went back.

Anyway, the bridge (surprisingly far from the water, 1.5km) is a
significant infrastructure project, with tons of concrete over the
river. There are some signs of the post-WWI settlement, but not many.
Yes, it is possible to engineer this bridge, but was it really a good
idea?  Well, I guess the engineers were just carrying out their
instructions.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">MP and me on the bridge; canoes docked; Rob's group on the bridge; bridge underside; jetboat maneuvers; raft.</figcaption>
</figure>


The jetboat then ferried canoes over the river for reasons unclear to us.
I heard something about a nosebleed in another group.

After just a bit more canoeing, we arrived at Tīeke Marae/Kāinga, where there
was (eventually) a powhiri to welcome us, by river guide Stacey, the
warden, and his son. The Asian group must have been staying across the river
at the Bridge to Nowhere Lodge; there was Rob's group, the group of 5,
the Aucklanders, the Germans, and Stacey's Canadian clients (maybe one other group). The bunkhouse at Tieke
Marae was far from full, and it was just us and the Germans in a room with
capacity 10.

# Day 5: Featuring the 50/50 Rapids; Tīeke to Pipiriki, 22km

* [Day 5 photos](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1849)

After day 1, the next hardest day is supposed to be day 5, from Tīeke
to Pipiriki. There are 5 significant rapids, of which the last
one (just before the dock at Pipiriki) is allegedly the hardest, with
50/50 representing the chance of swimming. This is also a short day,
with just 22km of paddling; we were told that leaving by 8am should
get us to the 1pm pickup on time.

We ate our ramen and managed to leave by 8.  The Germans and Rob's
group left before us. I was continually impressed by how quick Rob's
group was at logistics. Usually it takes a while for 14 people to
leave. Throughout the trip, the Germans paddled faster than us, but took more
breaks, and we always ended up at the destination before them.

Given how people had talked up this day, I stowed everything in
barrels.  I did run Gaia GPS tracking from my phone inside a
barrel. That works. No pictures between Tīeke and Pipiriki.

The weather was cloudy but, thankfully, windless. Our average speed
was again about 7km/h.  There were again fewer swallows than on the
first few days, though still some, and some grey ducks. Maybe one
shag.

Some of the rapids were noticeably harder than what we'd seen over the
past few days. But nothing was actually hard on this day, including
the 50/50.  Indeed, almost everyone got through the 50/50 without
swamping. It was definitely easier than in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=443U4oGeUis), even if everyone had said that it was hard around now due to the low water levels.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">River guide Stacey's crew; in the rapids; end of the journey.</figcaption>
</figure>

Despite starting after Rob's group, we caught up to them (as we always did) and were the
third canoe through the rapids. Afterwards, we had lots of time to
unpack our stuff from the barrels (since we were getting off the van
in Raetihi), enjoy the cupcakes and orange juice, and even take a
voluntary dip in the Whanganui. While we were repacking, others were loading
the canoes onto the trailer, which is quite a production.

_Emerald Hours_ said that Pipiriki had decent tourist infrastructure. Can't say, though Google shows only two adventure tour operator bases
and no hotels or restaurants in 2024.
We just stayed at the dock and then hopped in the minibus, which was about 30 minutes
to Raetihi.

# Back to Wellington

Raetihi is not bustling. There is a Four Square, one café that is open
all day (plus one morning-only café), and a tourist information centre.  Ohakune would
have been better (and has eclairs), but it's 10km down the road. I
think the InterCity bus comes from Ohakune.

The Taumarunui Canoe Hire van seems to have stopped at Ohakune before getting up; I saw a bag of carrots under the front seat, which is a thing you can get in Ohakune in addition to eclairs.

In any case, we made our way to Raetihi's [Coach Café](https://www.facebook.com/p/Coach-Cafe-Takeaways-100044359309214/). We had 2 hours there
before our pickup at 4. MP had bacon, egg & Hollaidaise and I had
creamy mushrooms and egg. Exceeded expectations. There were several
groups at the cafe, including a large group of older women when we
first came in, and then a family later.  Before leaving the cafe, we
checked out the tourist information; there was also a museum but we
didn't make it there before it closed at 3.  And, we took some
toasties (steak and onions, again excellent) to go.

<figure>

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Canoes and crew going back to Taumarunui; Raetihi.</figcaption>
</figure>


The InterCity bus was a few minutes late but got us to Bulls, where we changed
for the service to Wellington. The bus to Bulls stops in Whanganui briefly.
So we got to see the river once again. It is possible to paddle from Pipiriki
to Whanganui, though apparently there are fewer places to stay. It's probably
not as fun; I'd guess that it would be mostly flat and wide.

The bus to Wellington does not take [Transmission Gully](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/projects/wellington-northern-corridor/transmission-gully-motorway/) but stops in
Porirua and other places. I left my hat on the bus, oops.

Wellington was windy and cold. We waited 8 minutes for the #4 bus and
made it back to Kelburn.
