Some of the Canadian judo circuit tournaments are back-to-back; it
makes sense to make the trans-Pacific trip for two tournaments at a
time. In this case it is the Ontario Open and the Manitoba Open.
Since I am now registered with Judo Ontario and on the provincial
refereeing committee, I kind of have to go to the Ontario Open.

Plus, we had a paper at [Onward!](https://2024.splashcon.org/track/splash-2024-Onward-papers) and
I wanted to be there to talk it up to people. It would have been better to also be at HATRA,
but I couldn't do that.

So, the itinerary was Wellington to Toronto (to Waterloo), where I'd stay till Sunday, and then to Los Angeles for the week,
and back east to Winnipeg for that weekend, then back to Wellington. Nine flight segments over 5 days (counting days
is sort of complicated).

1. Oct 16: WLG-BNE, BNE-YVR, YVR-YYZ
2. Oct 20: YYZ-LAX
3. Oct 24: LAX-YVR, YVR-YWG
4. Oct 27: YWG-YVR, YVR-SYD, SYD-WLG

# Outbound to Toronto, October 16

It's always the 6am flights to Australia for the connections. Online
checkin didn't work, so the Uber on Wednesday morning was at 0354.
I guess the other options were walking (starting at 2am?) or biking
(leaving my bike there for almost two weeks?). But I also had lots of luggage.  Anyway, I was in the
international lounge by 0420, where I posted my [September
report](/post/20241005-september/) on October 16. Let's see if I beat
that this month (nope!).

</figure>

The flight to Brisbane was lightly loaded (50%?) and then I had to
wait for Air Canada staff to show up at T-90 before I could get my
boarding pass for that flight. The Brisbane connection was scheduled for 2h50 (but
longer due to early arrival), so I had to wait a while in the Air NZ
lounge. I think lounge staff in general are actually pretty good at
remembering who comes in: the person there remembered who I was
when she called to see whether the AC staff had shown up yet. At that
point, they had, and when I went to get my boarding pass, the AC staff
made sure that my luggage was correctly loaded onto the connection.
At that point it also showed up in baggage tracking in the Air Canada app,
which continues to become more useful.

I again managed to get an upgrade on this flight (from premium economy
to business) and it was great, also allowing me to compare the Air NZ and
Air Canada services. The Air Canada supper is in large quantity. I
worked on my Discovery Grant resubmission. Sleep is still not easy for
a daytime flight which arrives at 6:45AM in Canada; it's the other
direction which is easier to sleep on, but also performance is less
critical at trip end (unless enchaining trips!).

Landing in Vancouver, I was surprised to see that my bags were automatically transferred
onward to Toronto without me needing to physically bring them through at customs. That helped a lot! 
I guess someone or something looks at the picture of my baggage while the NEXUS system processes my entry.

I often fall for the bad hashbrowns at the YVR Maple Leaf Lounge. This
time, as has happened often recently, the lounge was pretty much at
capacity, and I had just eaten, and would again on the next segment, so
I resisted!

Flying from Vancouver to Toronto, the announcements were in fluent
French, and then I tried to order in French, but that was the other
flight attendant. "No, I actually do speak English" but most of the
time it was the bilingual FA serving anyway. The guy next to me had the
sniffles, but fortunately I didn't catch anything.

The "fun" part was bringing my stuff from the UP Express station to
Marco's place. Getting off the train is fine.  Lugging skis and two
big rolly suitcases 8 minutes from the Bloor station to the Dundas
station, not so fine.  Anyway, I managed.

I once again took a shower at Marco's place and then Marco, Blake, and
I went bouldering at Rock Oasis, where I also met up with Jeremy from
the OAC. (Blake has gotten pretty good at bouldering pretty
quickly). Late-night food in Toronto is not as obvious as one might
hope, but we did have some Korean at the [Yummy Korean Restaurant](http://www.yummykorean.com/) (yes,
that's the name) at 10:30pm.

# Stop in Kitchener/Waterloo, October 17-18

This trip did involve discharging a lot of obligations as well as life
maintenance.

</figure>

Well, there was no sleeping in on Thursday. I took the 9:42AM train to
Kitchener, so not too early, but not sleeping in. I had rearranged my
stuff to be easier to transport, but there was still two suitcases to drag. I
definitely did not want the GO train to GO bus shuffle. Fortunately, I got
the train all the way to Kitchener and then my tenants were kind
enough to pick me up and deliver me to my place where I could leave
stuff.  I also took note of the expired smoke detector and furnace
filter which I'd get replacements for.

I put some air in my bicycle tires and was off to do all the
errands, starting with the dentist. Props to the passport office in particular. I brought them
passport pictures taken the previous day in Toronto, plus my
pre-prepared application, at 2pm on Thursday, and they had my passport
by noon Friday, despite some broken computers on their end on Thursday.

Thanks also to Jon for hosting me in Kitchener for a night.

I also took my students out to lunch at the new Vietnamese place in
the plaza, ran through practice talks (2× HATRA) and MMath seminars,
returned my bike, got a flu shot, and caught the bus back to Toronto. I also gave away
a (big heavy) natural history book that I'd impulse purchased to an
audience that will surely appreciate it.

Fortunately, my luggage was subsequently reduced to one (heavy with
paper) backpack and sometimes one suit jacket bag (when not inside the
pack). My mobility greatly increased for the rest of the trip. It's
fortunate that Waterloo was right near the start of the trip.

# Ontario Open, October 19-20

The GO bus is not comfortable and it's hard to do work on it. I took
the first GO bus back to Square One and then transferred to the
Pearson GO bus.  At Pearson, I picked up a rental car. Greater Toronto
is not really feasible without a car. Things are too far and transit
isn't good enough. It's marginally feasible to get to the [Toronto Pan
Am Sports Centre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L5q8LDkByJzAgduG6) in
Scarborough from the airbnbs I usually stay at (walking, Uber), but
getting to Scarborough is no good, and definitely it is not possible to get to
the airport as quickly as I need to for my packed travel plans.

</figure>

Renting a car is often an annoying and slow experience. NZ rental experiences usually have been fastest in my experience.
Pearson is also often annoying and slow in general, though I can fortunately avoid some of that with NEXUS. It still takes
too long to pick up luggage.

I did, however, have intense dysphoria driving around the GTA on Friday night. It was so terrible.
Gerry had invited the Ontario Open referees to visit his judo club at the JCCC. In a case of user error, I programmed
the airbnb and not the dojo into my GPS, causing an extra half hour of rush hour driving. Afterwards, there was drinks
at York Mills, which was easy enough to get to, but horrendous to leave, due to the 401 being closed.
The drive from there to the airbnb would normally be 14 minutes but took 46 minutes and felt like an hour.

Trip |  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Distance | &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Time
---|---:|---:
YYZ - Scarborough | 38km | 51min 
 Scarborough - JCCC North York | 17km | 26min
 JCCC North York - York Mills | 5km | 8min
 York Mills - Scarborough | 22km | 46min

The tournament itself was good. The big Canadian tournaments (Ontario
Open, Quebec Open, Edmonton International) are continuing to get
bigger and I think they are now above pre-COVID numbers. Back in the
late 2010s there was some concern about tournament numbers, but at
least at the Canadian Circuit level there is reason for optimism about sufficient
numbers. The flip side is that we were refereeing from 8AM (roll call
7AM) until 21:30 on Saturday. Hopefully we can have 6 mat areas next
year.

Our plan to have a referee dinner was squashed by the late finish, and
options were basically nonexistent, because of the Pan Am Sports
Centre's prohibition on outside food. I took 4 of us to Caribbean Wave
nearby and then drove people back to the hotel. The TPASC facility is
pretty modern and fancy, but the location is bad, and the restrictions
are annoying. And it's just not big enough for the number of fighters we have now.

I'd looked at the timings from last year and figured that I should be
able to get to the airport just in time for my flight to California. I
often give people rides from the Ontario Open; this year's ride was to
Sandra flying to PEI. I'd reserved the rental car start on Friday for
19:00 but actually got to YYZ at 17:52, actually getting the car
keys around 18:15. They adjusted the start time to 18:00 (though I
sucessfully complained about the extra hour charge they had added with a 19:00 return) and I managed
to return the car at 18:28, after checking typical drive times
throughout the weekend (there's always traffic). There used to be an
extra hour of grace time but Alamo now has it at 30 minutes. Not a
great rental experience, but what is?

# SPLASH, October 21-24

Onward! Well, that's where I had one paper with my collaborators from
Tartu. Also, my student Alex and I had a HATRA paper which he
presented on Sunday while I was on the mats in Scarborough. I debriefed
him about it when I arrived, and he went to PLMW on Monday before missing his
Tuesday morning flight to his next conference (but nothing bad happened).

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20241116-big-trip-ontario-california-manitoba/lax">}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Flying in to LAX; airport hallways; Pasadena's Astro Motel; Pasadena and mountains behind.</figcaption>
</figure>

The YYZ transborder Maple Leaf Lounge was crowded, as they all seem to
be these days.  Fortunately, the 21:00 YYZ-LAX flight was on time (and
the earlier flight would have been 17:30, 20 minutes after I got to
the airport). With an 23:30 arrival into LAX, it is possible to take
the FlyAway bus to Union Station, but options from there to Pasadena
are limited at that time of day. I was offered a $30 taxi ride to
Pasadena, but who has cash, and I don't have Cash App. Instead I took
a $35 Uber (plus, grumble, tip).

Monday was light on scheduled activities, but not light enough for me
to really be able to explore the area. There is a tradeoff between
carrying more clothes and doing more laundry. Anyway, I had to do
laundry again.

I found myself again along Old Route 66 walking across Pasadena from
my hotel near the eastern end to the middle. This isn't the best way
to see Pasadena, though maybe it is the most representative. Pasadena City
College has a lush green campus with very college-looking buildings, and I had
an OK banh mi across the street from it.

Walking in parks (e.g. South Arroyo) or on mountains (Mount Wilson) is
nicer, but I couldn't really fit that in.

</figure>

On Monday and Tuesday, I did drop by SPLASH and talk to people, as
well as finish my Discovery Grant proposal and volunteering. I
remembered that [Rohan Padhye](https://rohan.padhye.org/)'s fuzzing
work could well be relevant to one of the projects I'm working on.

I registered for two days of SPLASH, Wednesday and Thursday, but was
also around a bit on Monday and Tuesday. SPLASH is an order of
magnitude bigger than SCAM (though that was a colocated event and I
can't speak to ICSME which it was colocated with), and I know a lot
more people at SPLASH than at SCAM.  It was nice to catch up with
people who I haven't talked to for years, what with this pandemic and
being in New Zealand and all. The layout of the conference hotel was
one of the better ones I'd seen for encouraging the hallway track;
sometimes the venues feel spread out and there is no concentration of
people.

I did spend quite some time finding the best place to stay
nearby. Pasadena isn't cheap, and it turns out the bus isn't that
reliable, sometimes taking a 10 minute delay. The Astro Hotel was
entirely satisfactory, though.

I didn't find the food in Pasadena to be spectacular. It was OK. The
breakfast sandwich from BC Donuts (also run by Vietnamese people) was
the highlight.  Pizza from The Luggage Room was pretty good, and I
liked Mama Lu's Dumpling House, though not everyone did.

It was also great to meet one of my collaborators, Karoliine from Tartu,
and help with practice runs for the talk. I was talking up the talk
all week when I was there and we had decent turnout.

Our [talk](https://patricklam.ca/papers/24.onward.abs-debug.slides.pdf) was on Thursday afternoon and I had to leave right after it.
But, my flight to YVR and then (next morning) to YWG was delayed, so
I didn't have to leave immediately.

# Manitoba Open, October 25-27

The final significant stop on this trip was a return to
Winnipeg, where I'd spent a long weekend last year, for the Manitoba
Open.  The last Onward! session on Thursday ended at 1730 and my
flight was originally scheduled for 2035, with one to two hours
(depending) from Pasadena to LAX on transit. Having received a flight
delay notification, I actually left the venue at 6 and arrived at
1945. I did not make the same mistake as Alex, did not put my bag in
the FlyAway under-bus storage, and got off at Terminal 1, walking over
to Terminal 7.

Annoyingly, they could only check my bag through to YVR due to the
"overnight" connection. So I'd have to wait to pick up the bag in
Vancouver and arrive early enough to check it in again. In the end, it
was a 2h44 delay, and I was at the gate in Vancouver at 0215, arriving
at the Panda Pod at 0300.  I had upgraded to business, so at least I
was waiting on the plane in a comfortable chair.

## Panda Pod

I thought I'd try out the Panda Pod near YVR. With a departure for YWG at 0815,
I figured that I'd better get there at 0715, so I set my alarm for 0620 (3 hours of sleep).

Good thing the Panda Pod is semi-cheap. $95 isn't really that cheap
but I don't see anything cheaper in Vancouver or Richmond. I've stayed at a nice
trailer on Sea Island a couple of times but didn't see it this time.
Yes, I'll pay $95 for 3 hours of sleep, though I didn't pay an extra
$25 for being able to set my alarm for 0640 instead, with a
potentially-unreliable taxi back to YVR. I would have had 6 hours if
there was no flight delay, and 7 hours if I didn't have to handle my bag.

Panda Pod is basically dorms with walls I guess. It seemed clean. I
did not investigate the showers, but it does provide showers, tea and
coffee, and kitchen, none of which were the optimal use of my
3h. Front desk is staffed 24h, poor guy (though friendly enough even
at 3am).  The pods are less isolated than, for instance, the
[YOTELAIR](https://patricklam.ca/post/20161103-yotel/) at Amsterdam
Schiphol. I didn't dig into my bag to find my sensor to check the CO2 level, since I wanted to try to at
least get some sleep.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Panda Pod; tarmac at YVR with mountains behind; HUG RUG at YWG (take that Dunedin).</figcaption>
</figure>

I took the SkyTrain back to YVR and arrived at 0708 in time for boarding
at 0740. YVR baggage in the morning always seems to have lines, though the priority
line was shorter. Again, the Maple Leaf Lounge was full, but it's not like
I had long to wait, and it's not like that food is worth it.

## Arriving in Winnipeg

LAX-YVR-YWG is a triangle, so I had 6 hours of flying instead of 3√2 hours.
I wouldn't really expect nonstop service LAX-YWG. YWG isn't exactly the biggest
city in Canada.

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20241116-big-trip-ontario-california-manitoba/triangle">}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Source: Google Maps Timeline.</figcaption>
</figure>


I landed at YWG around 1300. Miguel and Laura picked me up.
I needed to do laundry, so they dropped me off at a laundromat downtown,
and I did that, failing to get a haircut nearby (there was a place, but it was
full). It turns out that my airbnb had a laundry machine that I could have used,
oh well. The airbnb was great, except for a beeping noise I heard from the bedroom,
which was out of the host's control.

I had a banh mi for lunch at the best banh mi place I've ever eaten at,
[Banh Mi House](https://banhmihouse.ca/). Then I had another one for dinner before the
referee meeting. Sandra brought some oysters from PEI for the hospitality suite afterwards.
Thanks!

## Tournament

Some events are larger and some are smaller. The Manitoba Open is
definitely smaller than the Ontario Open, running 3 mats instead of
5. Perhaps it's about as big as the New Zealand Nationals. The Quebec
Open is even bigger than the Ontario Open, with 8 mats.  In any case,
the Manitoba Open was well-run, and we finished at 12:15 on Sunday. We had 74 matches
on our mat on Sunday, plus I picked up an extra 3 in a three-way tiebreaker. In
addition to the hospitality suite on Friday, Judo Manitoba took us out
to sushi on Saturday, and we finished early enough for that to happen.

I also had two mochi donuts (Umaido) after dinner. (I ordered one and got a freebie). I chose the airbnb to be close to the tournament
hotel so that I could get a ride to the tournament venue, but it is also happily close to the banh
mi place, and also a donut chain location.

I thought I'd try the pho at Banh Mi House on Sunday, after getting
dropped off at the tournament hotel.  No point going to the airport 5
hours before my flight. The pho was excellent but the banh mi is
superlative.

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20241116-big-trip-ontario-california-manitoba/manitoba">}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Banh Mi House menu; airbnb in Winnipeg; Manitoba Open ne-waza; VIA Rail in Winnipeg; Chinatown gate; inside a parking garage; fake balcony paintings; car-centric RONA.</figcaption>
</figure>

Then I took the bus (pretty full on a Sunday afternoon) to downtown
Winnipeg (not as much of a place as one might hope, but better than
Phoenix) and walked from there to the airport, managing to get a haircut
($25) along the way.  I tried to get change for a tip but the guy was
like "oh you have a $5 bill, I'll take that".

I met up again with some referees flying just two provinces west at the airport and then visited the
not-as-crowded YWG Maple Leaf Lounge, working on the October summary while there. (Almost done now!)
I also read some of the backlog of magazines that I've accumulated. Despite leaving a heavy book
in Ontario, I probably left with more paper than I came.

# Back to Wellington via Sydney, Oct 27-29

I did not manage to upgrade the YVR-SYD flight. My status wasn't high
enough and there weren't enough seats in Premium Economy. Oh well. I
still managed to get some sleep.  I was sitting next to someone from
Toronto who was visiting a friend in Sydney but had never been to
Australia before.

Since my bag was checked anyway, I was lightly loaded for my 9 hour
visit to Sydney.  It was scheduled for 9 hours but was actually more
like 7.5; we arrived 40 minutes late and it took the Australian Border
Force another 20 minutes to clear us for deboarding. I managed to get
outside 13 minutes after getting off the plane. Before my flight, I realized that I needed a new
Australian ETA: not only did I have a new passport, but my old ETA had
expired anyway. No problems with that.

<figure>

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Insecure bike storage at SYD; pied cormorant; galah; yellow-rumped thornbill; New Holland honeyeater; indigenous banners at SYD international hall.</figcaption>
</figure>

I tried to visit the Eve St wetlands but there was a pretty blunt sign
about it being a "NO GO ZONE" at the moment. The Landing Lights
wetlands had some new-to-me birds though, along with lots of pied stilts; worth a visit. I got a burek
and eclair (the latter from yet another Vietnamese bakery) and then
took the bus back to SYD a few hours early, where I did more OAC admin
and tried to catch up on 3 weeks' backlog for the te reo Māori course.

The flight from SYD to WLG arrives at 2340. I hadn't left my
bike at the airport for 2 weeks, so the options were to walk or to take
an Uber/taxi. I took an Uber.
