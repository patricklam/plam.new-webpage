Let's try to get this post out earlier. I'm starting it on June 27. I
could be writing papers right now, but it's 11pm, and I try to avoid
that when I can. I write papers all day and I write blog posts all
night.

June has been pretty routine, with one hiking trip to the Atene
Skyline Track in Whanganui National Park, and one judo trip to referee
at the Australian national championships. Then I've just been writing
papers for the rest of June.

I got around to measuring just far up the hill I live. The bike ride includes
126m elevation gain in 1.64km, with the steepest part being 40m in 300m. Oof.

# COVID

No revolutions this month either, but more knowledge. In NZ we are seeing slow declines, backed by wastewater numbers. I heard there is a surge in Japan.

# Professional

Full steam ahead on revisions to our Empirical Software Engineering paper (now resubmitted) and an invited
Journal of Systems and Software paper. 

Worked on 20 days; nominally 22 work days in June. Non teaching terms are indeed less intense than teaching
terms. There were some days with lots of writing and some days where I was... preparing to write. That always
happens. Hard for me to avoid the preparation time.

## Grad students/mentees

Let's say that I talked to students/former students/prospective students on 6 days (not counting Discord chats)
and mentees on 4 days.

## Research

Paper writing, as seen above. I sent a draft of some sections of my upcoming Discovery Grant application
to the university's Research Office for feedback. 

After I submit the JSS paper and after jury duty, I'll be working on a talk for Oracle Labs. 

## Teaching

I hosted the online part of an Open Forum about AI for the Faculty of Engineering.
We talked about possible implications of generative AI for our courses. It sure can create
text.

## Collegiality

Just some FAUW work. We'll see what happens with that.

# Trips

A judo trip (as well as a local judo tournament) and an outdoors trip.

## Australian Nationals, Gold Coast, June 9-12

Somehow I felt it was less stressful than the Canadian
nationals. Anyway, I had a good time refereeing at these nationals,
with fighters I didn't know at all. The Australian nationals are over
3 days and start at U12 I think. Canadian open nationals start at U16
but also include ne-waza-only fights (ground) on a fourth day.

I flew in to Gold Coast, which is about 100km from Brisbane, via
Auckland. This required a 6am flight from Wellington. I biked to the
airport at 4am. Biking back home up the hill was a bit beyond me and I
pushed the bike. Gold Coast in June is temperate, around 20C and
sunny.  I tried to see some birds and did see blue-faced honeyeaters
and rainbow lorikeets, but my time was pretty limited. Also rode the
trains around Brisbane. Only got lost once. Brisbane transit seems
relatively functional. It is bigger than Auckland and has far more trains.

## Whanganui National Park/Atene Skyline, June 16-18

This would be our first chance to get out on a longer trip since my
return to New Zealand.  Looking at nearby hikes, I found the Atene
Skyline track in Whanganui National Park, which was reasonable driving
distance from Wellington.

It was almost winter solstice and the walk is advertised as 6 to 8
hours. Typically we land right in the middle of the predicted
times. Sunset was around 5pm, so I figured it would be best to be on
the move by 10am; we made it to trailhead by 9am. I think the most
scenic part was the first part up to the Atene Viewpoint and just a
bit beyond, especially in the morning with the undercast. I was pleased to
finish in just under 6 hours including lunch.

Overall, a good first visit to Whanganui National Park, one of the
last ones on the list for me to visit. I hope we can do the Whanganui
River Journey this summer.

The next day, we went to Bushy Park. It's also near Whanganui, but in
a different direction. We had breakfast again at the Wanganui East
Breakfast & Cafe and headed out to the fenced sanctuary. We heard a
lot of birds (maybe even a rosella) and saw saddlebacks (no pictures),
fantails, lots of robins, tui, and I had a kereru dive bomb me. Vague flash
of a hihi.

## Travel planning

Although there are some trips I'd like to do in the next few months,
there's still some job uncertainty with MP. I did travel planning for
the Atene Skyline trip, which was easy; the Auckland International
Open (if jury duty doesn't stomp on that trip); Petrel Station in
Northland; and the NZAC Leading Ice course. Also Somes Island camping
trip for Matariki weekend.

International travel planning: IJF/PJU referee clinic in Calgary in
September, with stops in Seattle and Squamish. Manitoba Open and Ontario
Open in October. Thinking about SPLASH in Lisbon.

# Movement statistics

More walking than May, but that's not saying much. Only one day hike,
really. 20% below the monthly average from 2021/2022, but in an
average month I have more multi-day hikes than this June; those drive
the numbers up.  Surprisingly large amount of biking for
Wellington. Driving was to get to the hike mainly, plus to the
Wellington Open and around Gold Coast. And assorted Brisbane (mostly)
and Wellington transit, including a ferry this month. One medium-haul
flight to Australia.

* ðŸš¶ Walking: 102km on 20 days
* ðŸš² Biking: 119km on 13 days
* âœˆ  Plane: 5,488km (WLG-AKL-OOL, BNE-AKL-WLG)
* ðŸš— Driving: 859km on 9 days
* ðŸšŒ Bus: 38km on 3 days
* ðŸš† Train: 53km on 3 days (Wellington and Brisbane)
* â›´ Boat: 1.7km (Brisbane CityCat)
* &#x1F6A1; Cable car: 0.6km (1Ã—)

## Walks

* [Atene Skyline Track](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/manawatu-whanganui/places/whanganui-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/atene-skyline-track/), 16.5km (2.2km road to close the loop), +/- 750m. Nice undercast and good views to first viewpoint. Locally famous trail run. Steep but well-formed.

Also a couple of smaller walks: around Porirua, to Wrights Hill, and on the Paraparaumu beach.

# Pictures

Lots! Cleared some 2021 backlog and did a bunch of 2023 pictures. Didn't touch any 2022 pictures.

# Miscellaneous

## Acquisitions
* [Peak design Slide Lite Camera Strap](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/slide-lite): a bit more maneuverable than the default Sony strap.

We did get an ebike for MP but that's not really my purchase. I did
get new brake pads for my bike, because the old ones were kind of
scary. The guy at the store kindly installed them for me. I think I
had them on backwards or something.

## Sports

Fought in the Wellington Open (silver in SM-66), refereed all weekend. Judo practice 6Ã—, including once at Shin-gi-tai
in Sydney. No climbing; meant to go on June 30th but didn't make it.

## Restaurants

Wellington:
* [Boundary Tap & Kitchen](https://www.boundarykapiti.nz/): standard place for dinner after the Wellington Open in Raumati Beach
* [Kisa](https://kisarestaurant.co.nz/kitchen/), flavours are kind of subtle, good cured market fish and really good tahr kebab; eggplant not as tasty as I'd hoped.
* [Caffe Mode](https://www.facebook.com/CaffeMode/): Just pointing out that they have mochi (which is actually from Moore Wilson's, they told us).
* [Mediterranean Foods Trattoria & Deli](https://www.medifoods.co.nz/trattoria-italian-restaurant-and-pizza/): the correct pizza

Gold Coast/Brisbane:
* [Taboon Modern Middle Eastern Cafe](https://taboon.com.au/): lamb shoofta pizza, not quite a pizza (not on pizza bread) but I liked it
* [Baba Joon Persian Grill](https://www.babajoon.com.au/): right next to our hotel (voco) and the gheymeh was indeed flavourful
* [Kurrawa Surf Club](https://www.kurrawasurf.com.au/): Sri Lankan seafood curry, also flavourful
* [Pho Lewis Tran](https://www.pholewistran.com.au/): my banh mi was very meaty, though I prefer more balance with the vegetables

Whanganui:
* [Wanganui East Bakery and Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/p/Wanganui-East-Bakery-Coffee-100076246489672/): great pies
* Kebabholik: good mixed plate and tech YouTube as well (?!)
* [Tasty Indian](https://www.tastyindianwhanganui.co.nz): was not bad

## Volunteering

Refereeing at Wellington Open, Australian judo nationals, OAC, FAUW. The OAC is working hard on a letter campaign for
[climbing in parks](https://climbinparks.ca), which is a Hugo site linking to Action Network for sending emails.

## Books

I borrowed 7 books from the library, and I've read one of them so far.

* Brian Parkinson. _Explore New Zealand Nature: A Natural History Road Trip_. 2022.

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20230701-june/exploring-nz-nature" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Fantail; Whanganui River from holiday park; view from Atene Skyline track.</figcaption>
</figure>

Parkinson describes, of course, birds, but also trees, weta, and sometimes rocks all around New Zealand. He also 
points out the natural *history* part, where there used to be a lot more birds than there are now, especially the 
huia. He provides a fairly comprehensive tour of New Zealand. I really have been to most of the places that he 
describes, plus some others---especially the ones that aren't accessible by road. Some of the places (e.g. Mana 
Island) are normally inaccessible to normal people.

Doing this as actual road trips would be, for me, the worst. But I definitely would be interested in stopping by 
some of these places for a second visit should I happen to be in the neighbourhood. Probably I wouldn't actually 
see many of the birds he mentions. But it's worth a try. And I could learn more about trees. I know many birds, 
but I'm pretty hopeless with NZ plants.

This book looks to be worth owning outright; the blessing and the curse of the library book is that you're not 
supposed to keep it. That's great when it's one-time-use, less so when it's reference material.

# Conclusion

Just plugging away at research, which is nice. Need to get to some more travel planning for the next few months
around New Zealand.
