Since I last wrote, New Zealand moved to alert level 4 on a 4-point scale. Only essential workers may go to work, and "essential workers" is narrowly defined here: mostly supermarkets, pharmacies, and gas stations. Since I'm not going anywhere, I thought I'd send a picture from the archives. I took this picture close to home, in Waterloo Park, September 2019. I have to admit that I prefer being farther afield, but that's not always an option, for various reasons. But, one can always explore one's backyard. (Please do so safely!)
