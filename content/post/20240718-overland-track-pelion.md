Now I'm onto processing photos from day 5, so the [day 4 photos](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1906) are also available. Actually, as I write this, I already have the day 4 writeup done. I accidentally wrote out of sequence, but I don't really want to post out of sequence. So here's day 3.

# Day 3, from Windermere Hut to New Pelion Hut
