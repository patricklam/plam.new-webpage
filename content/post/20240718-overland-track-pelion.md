I was worried about running ahead of the photos, but I guess I don't need to worry about that anymore; there is just one more small return day to go. Actually, as I write this, I already have the day 4 writeup done. I accidentally wrote out of sequence, but I don't really want to post out of sequence. So here's day 3 of the track.

# Day 3: Windermere Hut to New Pelion Hut

It's not in the booklet, but this was mud day. We'd had lots of
boardwalk for the first two days, but they don't quite cover the
entire 65km of the Overland Track, as we found out on this day.  The
pictures in the booklet for this day include some boardwalk and also
some terrain that I'm pretty sure was muddy when we went through but
dry in the picture. And I think we went through on some of the driest
days of the year.

(If you read between the lines, you can find some hints: "mainly natural `gravel' surface
with some planking and cordwood", emphasis mine. "Lowest section of the Overland Track" and "myrtle-beech rainforest").

There are few side trips on this day. There is a 5 minute side trip to
Forth Valley, and a 30 minute side trip to Old Pelion Hut, which we
did not take. And it is possible to go to Mount Oakleigh after
reaching New Pelion Hut.  But it's already a 5-7 hour day (16km,
+242m, -380m) and Oakleigh adds 4-6 hours. There is enough daylight for fast walkers,
but barely. It took us 5.5 hours moving time/7 hours total time
without side trips.

# Morning

There was legit mist in the morning when we got up at 6:45. Cool views
with the rising sun and the mist.  Went out to look for birds and
platypuses back near Lake Windermere, but all we saw was a black
currawong.  We went back to the hut and then actually left around
7:30.

# Walking through swamps

The next part of the day was under blue sky through buttongrass
moorland. Low clouds did persist, but more of an undercast. We had
tarns and mountains (still Barn Bluff, as well as Pelion West). Also,
for some reason, two shovels that presumably staff left on the track.

The Forth Valley view is a bit different from mountains and
moorlands. It's a valley. We heard, but did not see, parrots.

Once we started losing elevation and getting into the forest, the
track got muddy. Halfway through, we reached Frog Flats. I washed my
shoes around there, hoping there wouldn't be more mud. There was more
mud.

After the lowland forests, we got back up to the moorlands again, now
with Mount Oakleigh in view.

# Fauna and fungi

Despite the paucity of birds in the morning, we did see more birds at New Pelion Hut,
including a good view of a nearby noisy yellow wattlebird, superb fairywren, and yellow-throated honeyeater.
It looked like a bird but it was actually silver banksia. And we saw a broad-toothed mouse.

We saw a lot of fungi on this day, though it's hard to identify. There is a Facebook group to help ID
Tasmanian fungi but I'm too shy to post all the pictures there. When you upload fungi to iNaturalist,
usually nothing happens.

Flora: some mountain pinkberry. Apparently those aren't the edible berries. If I recall correctly, the purple ones
are the edible ones.
