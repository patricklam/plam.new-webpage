# April 4: GO Bus fail

My initial plan was to take the GO Bus to Toronto on Wednesday
evening. All I managed to do was to wait for the 25 for 15 minutes.  I
lost patience and leveraged the fact that I had a bike to go to the
Kitchener Charles stop, where I waited for the 30 for another 15
minutes. Weather: -2C with 40km/h wind. There was some sort of 401
meltdown going Westbound, so the inbound buses never made it. I gave
up and figured I'd have better luck the next day.

# April 5: Kitchener to Toronto

Second try. This time I took the GO 30 bus from Kitchener Terminal, dropping
me off at Bramalea GO. I needed to get to my airport hotel, the Hotel
Carlingview Toronto Airport. It's only 11.1km, but it was the worst
11km in the whole trip.  That area is incredibly hostile for people on
bicycles (and on foot). Yet there were still people waiting for
buses. Basically highways (including lots of trucks) with sidewalks.
Had I known, I probably would have put my bike on a city bus.

* First use of adjustable wrench: put brake pad back on bicycle.

Now I needed a bike box. Air Canada supposedly used to provide plastic
bags for bicycles but didn't advertise that anymore. I took the TTC 52
to the UP Express (Weston), getting off at Union and walking to the
MEC, where they found a used cardboard box they could give
me. Avoided: first unrecoverable failure (no-bike-box).

After dinner with Marco, I took the subway to Lawrence West and the 52
back to the hotel. Since transit is slow, that took an hour from
downtown Toronto. Got in around 10pm with a bike box.

* Second use of adjustable wrench: disassembling bicycle (along with 15mm wrench).

The next question mark was whether I would be able to box my bike.
I'd never done it, but I wasn't too concerned about that. The Internet
is pretty good at explaining. I was most concerned about the seatpost.
But this bike was relatively new to me, and had not been stored
outside, so I managed to remove the seatpost easily. Pedals, fork, and
derailleur were easy. Fifteen minutes later I had a bike in a box. I
taped the box shut, but it turns out that this is not useful, because
the luggage people at the airport want to see the contents, since the
bike box doesn't fit on the X-ray machine.

# April 6: Toronto to Amqui via YUL, YBC, YYY

The only viable flight for my adventure got me out of YYZ at 0700,
connecting to YUL-YYY (stop at YBC) at 0905, arriving at YYY at
1130. Allowing time for potential airport snafus (yes, it's true that
if you don't miss a flight, you're spending too much time at airports,
but I actually do consider consequences sometimes) I left the airport
hotel at 0515 and checked in the bike with 0 snafus and $0 in extra
fees (yay status!).

Early April in southern Ontario may be spring-like (when there aren't
snowstorms), but particularly past Montreal, early April is still
winter, if you go by the colour of the ground. The flight attendant
Hisham on YUL-YYY wondered if he had seen me at some MMA dojo in
Montreal... nope, not me, but it would be a reasonable thing to think.
He had to leave the aircraft door open for the 35-minute stop in
YBC. That's fine in June, but the -17 air in YBC was bracing. 

At YBC we had about 15 women and 1 man board the aircraft enroute for
YUL---for them it was 1stop via YYY. I guess Air Canada sells tickets
for YUL-YBC, YUL-YYY, YBC-YYY, YBC-YUL, all as AC8968.

Mont-Joli (YYY) is quite close to Baie-Comeau (YBC) as the plane
flies, and may be my shortest segment ever. It's 34 nautical miles
(shorter than YVR-YYJ), takes 20 minutes gate-to-gate (13 minutes in
the air), and has max altitude 4000'.

After deplaning at YYY, I watched closely for signs of my bike box.  I
was satisfied to see it coming off the plane. Some random
English-speaking guy flying into Mont-Joli helped hold my bike while I
assembled it. I gave away my bike box to some staff at a check-in desk
and set off.

... but not so fast. I immediately noticed that the front wheel needed
a bit of truing.

In any case, 15 minutes later I'd fixed my wheel and biked through
downtown Mont-Joli (it is indeed a pretty town). I thought it would be
wise to check out the train station. The train ticket I'd purchased
originated at Mont-Joli. This town has a physical station, but the station
is unstaffed, and Via Rail claims that bicycles can't be loaded there.

Mont-Joli would have been a fine choice for lunch, but I figured that
there might be weather, so it would be best to get to Amqui as soon as
possible.

I made good time on the bike: 2h54 (Google predicted 2h59) for 53km to
the Cantine La Paysanne. My sort of crappy bike worked
fine. Conditions were still winter, with full-on cornices on road cuts
and wet roads due to recent snow. I had less shoulder than I would
have liked. However, the route is part of Quebec's cyclotourism Route
Verte, so it was still good. Less scary than biking in Brampton for
sure.

Seen along the way, in addition to cornices: epic churches in towns of
6000; cemetaries with crucified Jesus statues; Fleuriste Desjardins;
avec-service gas stations; cantines.

Upon arriving in Sayabec I started thinking that I might be close
enough for lunch. But the Google reviews of Resto Chez Mylene were
sort of mediocre.  La Paysanne had far better reviews. They had no
interior seating, and it was still winter, so I had to take the food
to the Gite. I ordered a poutine and a guedille crevette (like a
lobster roll, but with shrimp and mango). Never had a guedille before.

The total elevation gain was 753m. One climb early on felt hard on my
crappy bike, but the stats suggest that it's only 119m over 2.8km.
