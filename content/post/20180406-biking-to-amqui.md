# April 4: GO Bus fail

My initial plan was to take the GO Bus to Toronto on Wednesday
evening. All I managed to do was to wait for the 25 for 15 minutes.  I
lost patience and leveraged the fact that I had a bike to go to the
Kitchener Charles stop, where I waited for the 30 for another 15
minutes. Weather: -2C with 40km/h wind. There was some sort of 401
meltdown going Westbound, so the inbound buses never made it. I gave
up and figured I'd have better luck the next day.

# April 5: Kitchener to Toronto

Second try. This time I took the GO 30 bus from Kitchener Terminal, dropping
me off at Bramalea GO.

<br />

* First use of adjustable wrench: put brake pad back on bicycle.

I needed to get to my airport hotel, the Hotel Carlingview Toronto
Airport. It's only 11.1km, but it was the worst 11km in the whole
trip.  That area is incredibly hostile for people on bicycles (and on
foot). Yet there were still people waiting for buses. Basically
highways (including lots of trucks) with sidewalks.  Had I known, I
probably would have put my bike on a city bus. Anyhow, I got to the
hotel, checked in, and stored my bike in the room.

Now I needed a bike box. Air Canada supposedly used to provide plastic
bags for bicycles but didn't advertise that anymore. I took the TTC 52
to the UP Express (Weston), getting off at Union and walking to the
MEC, where they found a used cardboard box they could give
me.

* Avoided: first unrecoverable failure (no-bike-box).

<figcaption style="text-align:center">As it should [not] be.</figcaption>
</figure>

After dinner with Marco, I took the subway to Lawrence West and the 52
back to the hotel. Since transit is slow, that took an hour from
downtown Toronto. Got in around 10pm with a bike box.

* Second use of adjustable wrench: disassembling bicycle (along with 15mm wrench).

The next question mark was whether I would be able to box my bike.
I'd never done it, but I wasn't too concerned about that. The Internet
is pretty good at explaining. I was most concerned about the seatpost and
it being rusted in place (as it was on my good bike).
But this bike was relatively new to me, and had not been stored
outside, so I managed to remove the seatpost easily. Pedals, fork, and
derailleur were easy. Fifteen minutes later I had a bike in a box.

# April 6: Toronto to Amqui via YUL, YBC, YYY

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20180406-biking-to-amqui/baggage-carts" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Don't tape your bike box too early!</figcaption>
</figure>

I taped the box shut, but it turns out that this is not useful,
because the luggage people at the airport want to see the contents,
since the bike box doesn't fit on the X-ray machine.

The only viable flight for my adventure got me out of YYZ at 0700,
connecting to YUL-YYY (stop at YBC) at 0905, arriving at YYY at
1130. Allowing time for potential airport snafus (yes, it's true that
if you don't miss a flight, you're spending too much time at airports,
but I actually do consider consequences sometimes) I left the airport
hotel at 0515 and checked in the bike with 0 snafus and $0 in extra
fees (yay status!).

Early April in southern Ontario may be spring-like (when there aren't
snowstorms), but particularly past Montreal, early April is still
winter, if you go by the colour of the ground. The flight attendant
Hisham on YUL-YYY wondered if he had seen me at some MMA dojo in
Montreal... nope, not me, but it would be a reasonable thing to think.
He had to leave the aircraft door open for the 35-minute stop in
YBC. That's fine in June, but the -17 air in YBC was bracing.

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20180406-biking-to-amqui/ybc" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Brief stop at Baie-Comeau!</figcaption>
</figure>

At YBC we had about 15 women and 1 man board the aircraft enroute for
YUL---for them it was 1stop via YYY. I guess Air Canada sells tickets
for YUL-YBC, YUL-YYY, YBC-YYY, YBC-YUL, all as AC8968.

Mont-Joli (YYY) is quite close to Baie-Comeau (YBC) as the plane
flies, and may be my shortest segment ever. It's 34 nautical miles
(shorter than YVR-YYJ), takes 20 minutes gate-to-gate (13 minutes in
the air), and has max altitude 4000'.

{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20180406-biking-to-amqui/over-the-fleuve" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Flying over the Fleuve St.-Laurent.</figcaption>
</figure>

After deplaning at YYY, I watched closely for signs of my bike box.  I
was satisfied to see it coming off the plane. Some random
English-speaking guy flying into Mont-Joli helped hold my bike while I
assembled it. I gave away my bike box to some staff at a check-in desk
and set off.

... but not so fast. I immediately noticed that the front wheel needed
a bit of truing.

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20180406-biking-to-amqui/snow-bike" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Assembled bike in Mont-Joli snow.</figcaption>
</figure>

In any case, 15 minutes later I'd fixed my wheel and biked through
downtown Mont-Joli (it is indeed a pretty town).

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20180406-biking-to-amqui/mont-joli" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Train station and church in Mont-Joli.</figcaption>
</figure>

I thought it would be wise to check out the train station. The train
ticket I'd originally purchased originated at Mont-Joli, but I decided
to instead board earlier at Campbellton NB. This town has a physical
station, but the station is unstaffed, and Via Rail claims that
bicycles can't be loaded there. Front-line train staff said it would
actually probably be OK.

Mont-Joli would have been a fine choice for lunch, but I figured that
there might be weather, so it would be best to get to Amqui as soon as
possible.

I made good time on the bike: 2h54 (Google predicted 2h59) for 53km to
the Cantine La Paysanne. My sort of crappy bike worked
fine. Conditions were still winter, with full-on cornices on road cuts
and wet roads due to recent snow. I had less shoulder than I would
have liked. However, the route is part of Quebec's cyclotourism Route
Verte, so it was still good. Less scary than biking in Brampton for
sure.

Seen along the way, in addition to cornices: epic churches in towns of
6000; cemetaries with crucified Jesus statues; Fleuriste Desjardins;
avec-service gas stations; cantines.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Cornice on the Route Verte!</figcaption>
</figure>

Upon arriving in Sayabec I started thinking that I might be close
enough for lunch. But the Google reviews of Resto Chez Mylene were
sort of mediocre.  La Paysanne had far better reviews. They had no
interior seating, and it was still winter, so I had to take the food
to the Gite Grand-Père Nicole, where I was staying. I ordered a
poutine and a guedille crevette (like a lobster roll, but with shrimp
and mango). Never had a guedille before.

<figure>

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Gite Grand-P&egrave;re Nicole, and a guédille and poutine</figcaption>
</figure>

The total elevation gain was 753m. One climb early on felt hard on my
crappy bike, but the stats suggest that it's only 119m over 2.8km.

La Paysanne was most but not all of my riding that day. I continued
another 1.1km to the Gite with the food in a paper bag, checked in,
talked to the nice B&B host, ate my lunch, and then continued on
another 14km to La Captive for dinner. Then (this is important later
on) I locked my bike to a post outside the Arena, getting a ride back
to the Gite.

## Stealing my bike

After the tournament all I had to do was to ride my bike to the bus stop
at JoJo and then take transit all the way back home. Easy right? Oops,
there was still a twist.

I'd locked my bike to a post with a sign. In an attempt to lighten my
load, I think that I had left all my keys at home except for my bike
key.  That's a mistake. Keys on their own are easy to lose. After
looking for the key several times in all of my stuff, I gave up.

OK, so now I have a locked up bike and need to get to the bus stop
2.3km away. I could abandon my bike in Amqui but that's just
littering.

Next idea: steal my bike! The thing about locking a bike to a post is
that it's topologically equivalent to an locked-only-to-self bike: one
can free the bike by lifting it above the post. Of course I'm not tall
enough to do so. So I enlisted a city staffer to help me steal my
bike.  Clearly I don't look sketchy. He and his colleague used a
pick-up truck which provided sufficient height. Unscrewing the panel
and lifting the bike onto the truck worked.

* Third use of adjustable wrench: getting panel off post and replacing it.

Still, 2.3km is awfully far to walk a self-locked bike and it would be
really inconvenient for the rest of the trip, not to mention that this
lock was really not very useful to me in the future. Locks can be
removed with bolt cutters or angle grinders. The city staffer didn't
have such tools (or we wouldn't have needed to lift). This could have
gone poorly, because garages are closed on Sundays and the two Amqui
hardware stores are also closed on Sundays. I started walking towards
the bus stop with the locked wheel off the ground.

Quebec in 2018. Not beyond Asian racial epithets, I found, walking in
Amqui. I guess this is not a surprise to anyone affected by Bill 21.

Even though everything was closed, I heard noises from an industrial
building. Some guy was working in the welder's shop after hours and
I talked him into cutting the lock for me. Hurrah!

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Freedom!</figcaption>
</figure>

At JoJo I still had a couple of hours to wait for the bus so I had
another poutine and waited. I loaded the bike onto the bus and got off
at Matapédia 50 minutes later. I did not check out the nearby ski
resort "Le Petit Chamonix". It might not quite compare to the real
thing: it has 13 runs and 150m of elevation. Still, the B&B host had
mentioned that the snow around here was much softer than around
Montreal, which is often icy.

## Bike ride to Campbellton

I biked the remaining 22km to Campbellton NB, stopping at the Lieu
historique national de la Bataille-de-la-Ristigouche (nothing to see
in April but snow, though Wikipedia says that it hastened the fall of
Montreal) and crossing the bridge to New Brunswick around sunset. Loads
of time between bus arrival at 5pm and train departure at 11pm.

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20180406-biking-to-amqui/welcome-to-nb" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Welcome to New Brunswick / Bienvenue au Nouveau-Brunswick</figcaption>
</figure>

I try to learn something about the places I pass through. What I
learned about Campbellton was that it had the distinction of having
the most population degrowth in NB between the two last censuses.

I successfully checked my bike (in a Via Rail provided plastic bag,
for a modest fee) and ignored the station attendant's suggestion to go
to Pizza Delight for dinner (it was also up a hill). I checked out the
regional chain Dixie Lee but didn't want fried chicken so went to the
newly renovated Al's Pizzeria instead. From talking to the pizzeria
staff, someone decided to pump a bunch of money into renovating this
restaurant. Good to see investment into small towns.

With several more hours in Campbellton I decided to check out Tap's
Bar.  On a Sunday night I was the only customer there for a
while. Then someone else came. New Brunswick is Canada's only
officially bilingual province and everyone I talked to switched
languages effortlessly (like me and almost all young native Montrealers).

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Tap's Bar; Bike, check.</figcaption>
</figure>

On to the train. Via Rail's Ocean from Halifax to Montreal ran the
same equipment as the Canadian from Toronto to Vancouver in my rides
on both of these trains. I had thought about getting a seat but
decided that a berth was the way to go for an overnight train.
Reversing my trip, the train didn't take that long to get back through
Amqui and Mont-Joli before continuing to Montreal.

# April 9: to Montreal to Toronto to Waterloo

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20180406-biking-to-amqui/montreal-and-toronto" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Montreal and Toronto.</figcaption>
</figure>

After a good night's sleep, the Ocean passes through Quebec
(Sainte-Foy), Drummondville, and the south shore of Montreal, all
familiar territory for me. The connection in Montreal to the single
Corridor train with a baggage car was painless and I arrived in
Toronto Union Station at 4:15pm.

<figure>
{{< gallery-slider dir="/img/20180406-biking-to-amqui/bike-in-toronto" >}}
<figcaption style="text-align:center">Toronto Union Station with a less-clean bike</figcaption>
</figure>

There was one more challenge, though. We were now at rush hour in
Toronto.  How to get back to Waterloo? I called Metrolinx to ask for
advice and they didn't have anything either: either I bike to Square
One or 407. The GO Train is only open to folding bikes in rush hour
and I'd chosen to not take the folding bike. But there are also no GO
buses out of Union Station at that time; the first bus would be in a
couple of hours.


Fortunately, I had a bike and could get to Square One. There was
surprisingly decent segregated bike infrastructure for the most part,
except for the part where there was a car parked in the bike line of
course. Lots better than getting to YYZ.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Toronto biking infrastructure: parking fail; the trail under the QEW.</figcaption>
</figure>

The route was Lakeshore
through to eventually Etobicoke Creek (there was "interesting" riding
along the creek at some point) and east on Burnhamthorpe. An hour and
50 minutes later I got to Square One and took the 25 to WLU and biked
home.

That was fun, but in 2019 I flew round-trip to YYY and got a ride in a car.
