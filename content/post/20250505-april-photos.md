summary:    "March was a doozy, so here are the two sets I processed in March, as well as April's pictures."

I just had zero time in March and processed just 151 photos in 2 sets (from Japan). April was more normal. But I also added a lot of sets of photos to process: 7 in March and 12 in April, with the April sets being substantial. More digging of myself into a hole, I guess.

# Brașov (August 2012)

I can't remember why right now, but I decided to do a set from the pretty deep archives: Brașov, from our trip to Romania in August 2012. There are a lot more days from that trip, but I'm not doing them now. I did copy some other sets to my computer though. I'm in Estonia right now and it's kind of a bit similar to Romania.

# Aurora australis, or not (May 2024)

There was a massive solar storm in May 2024 and heaps of people came out to Island Bay in Wellington (41°S) to try
to see the aurora. Unfortunately it was mostly cloudy. I saw some green. I tried the next day as well, but
there was definitely no aurora that day. Anyway, here are some pictures. The reject rate was extremely high
for the aurora attempts, 10/78.

# French Polynesia (December 2024&ndash;January 2025)

French Polynesia isn't *that* close to Aotearoa New Zealand, but it's relatively close compared to other places.
We went during the Christmas vacation. Here's one day of photos, from the West Coast of Tahiti, including
waterfalls and hikes, a museum, and snorkelling (but no pictures of that). Also supper was pretty epic.

# Japan (February 2025)

Just some pictures of travel days and city visits for now. The hiking pictures are to come, at least on my site. MP has posted her selection, e.g. [Nakahechi to Koguchi](https://gallery.mpdesjardins.ca/index.php?/category/75). My laptop being dead means that the trip report is currently on hold.
