I thought I was mostly done with the NSERC Discovery Grant, but I worked on it a lot in October as well. Apart from that,
Alex presented our VSTTE paper; I talked to some prospective students; and I recertified my Wilderness First Responder in Whitehorse.

# Health news

Huh. Having accurate health recommendations, and acting on them, helps. Science!
* [US food allergy rates drop 36%](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/well/peanut-allergy-drop.html)

More vaccine-related news:
* [HPV vaccines reduce cervical cancer rate even among unvaccinated](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1099993): good enough to induce herd immunity.
* [2024-2025 season COVID vaccines still reduce rates of emergency department visits, hospitalization, and death (by 64%)](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-study-finds-annual-covid-vaccines-protect-people-against-severe-disease/)
* [Recent mRNA COVID vaccination correlated with higher survival rate after immunotherapy](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/study-suggests-mrna-covid-19-vaccines-can-improve-chances-cancer-survival); also in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03432-7) but paywalled; and covered in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/12/covid-mrna-vaccines-cancer-patients-prolong-life) also.

And non-vaccine news:
* [A universal SARS-CoV-2 antagonist](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08819-w) (but these things often don't work and are years away); from the article: "Our serum stability studies are clearly not the same as in vivo animal experiments; unfortunately, in vivo pharmacokinetic studies are not currently possible."

# Professional
It really was a lot of Discovery Grant writing in October. I sure am glad I wasn't teaching this term. Any other things I did involved a lot less work. This was 24 work days in October out of 22 work days (in addition to the WFR, which wasn't work.) Also, as I said above, I supported Alex's VSTTE presentation.

## Teaching

I did not start SE465 prep in October&mdash;that'll be November.

## Grad students/mentees/collaborators

Meetings on 8 days. Also 2 former SE undergrads, now long graduated.
There was a suitcase transfer following a failure to short-check luggage, but that's not my story to tell ("cursed suitcase").

## Collegiality/Service

TOSEM review. FAUW governance. Second round of questions for a master's student.

# Trips

Just the one trip to Ontario and Whitehorse (via Auckland) for just under 2 weeks, otherwise stayed around Wellington.
Pictures from Wellington:

## Trip: Ontario and Whitehorse
Left for Auckland on the Wednesday on a separate itin, stayed overnight near the airport, then flew to Toronto via
Brisbane and Vancouver.

Then to Whitehorse (with a YYZ-YYC-YVR-YXY flight), where I managed to meet up with Lucas on his way
from Alaska to California:

</figure>
And then back to Wellington for the end of the month, via Vancouver (meeting up with Spencer), Brisbane, and Sydney.
Unfortunately, I was hoping to go to a
New Zealand Alpine Club (Wellington Section) event the day I got back to Wellington, but deicing in Vancouver
caused a misconnect in Brisbane. I got an extra 6 hours in Sydney out of it.
I couldn't find any better routings with seats
available. I thought that all the Kiwis were going to Australia, but there were few seats from Australia to NZ.

## Travel Planning

I've noticed a couple of times that airbnb hosts have been cancelling
on me more often recently. Had to re-plan a night in Auckland this
month.

As I mentioned above, I failed to travel plan an improved itinerary back to Wellington after a flight delay.

# Movement statistics
Some driving, one trans-pacific flight, and otherwise pretty normal, with not much walking.

Movement statistics:
* 🚶 Walking: 66km on 16 days
* 🚲 Biking: 69km on 13 days
* 🚗 Driving: 557km on 9 days (mostly Ontario, some Whitehorse)
* 🚗 Taxi: 113km on 5 days (YYZ-Waterloo, within Waterloo to my airport ride, Whitehorse, WLG)
* 🚆 SkyTrain: 31km (Vancouver)
* 🚆 Train: 36km (Auckland)
* 🚌 Bus: 39km on 5 days (Wellington, Auckland, Whitehorse, Brisbane inter-terminal)
* ✈ Plane: 39561km (WLG-AKL-BNE-YVR-YYZ, YYZ-YYC-YVR-YXY, YXY-YVR-BNE-SYD-WLG)
* 🚠 Cable car: 0.7km (1× Wellington)

106km of transit, which was buses and trains in Wellington, Auckland, Whitehorse, and Sydney.

## Walks

Tried to keep up the walking, but really not much. There was 12km around Whitehorse when I had a free morning there
before leaving (took the noon flight not the 5am flight).

# Pictures

* [Full pictures post for October 2025](/post/20251101-october-photos)

In October I was working on my NSERC Discovery proposal, so I may have procrastinated sometimes by processing pictures. I selected about as many pictures as I did in July (887 versus 846), but the total number of pictures processed was 27% higher in July (3354 versus 2642). July did include a large collection of Estonian bird photos (710) and a walk up to Apostolidis (528). This month, on the other hand, I had lots of tiny sets, including in-transit days. Still, there were 13 over-100-picture days.

# Miscellaneous

Less miscellany to report than September.

## Posts

None this month. I did have to fix this site due to a Hugo upgrade. Yay not-so-well-documented breaking changes and plugins.

## Acquisitions

* got a spoke fixed on my bicycle, as well as new brake pads ($100).
* my dentist in Waterloo seems to be encouraging people to get night guards. I have one. I'm not sure I actually like it.
* massive Cooker King &mdash; Master Chef wok for C$26 in Richmond. It's hard to find a non-treated wok.

## Sports

Bouldering at Faultline 8× (including a coaching session), plus one day bouldering at Grand River Rocks, plus one day at Rattlesnake Point (Ontario) with an old friend from CEGEP. Did not make it to the new Whitehorse climbing gym. Judo 4×, which was pretty much all of the times I was in town except the day immediately after getting back.

## Food

Didn't have cooking facilities in Whitehorse, so I explored some restaurants there. But first, Ontario:
* [Markham Station](https://markhamstation.com/): despite the name, actually in Scarborough; competent diner, not crowded on a Friday night.
* [Fratelli Village Pizzeria](https://www.fratellis.ca/): small place; good pasta, also in Scarborough; pizza oven broken when we were there (they warned us)
* [Naan Kabob](https://naankabob.ca/): 10-location chain with good kabob and somehow lots of birthdays on a Sunday
* Banh Mi Saigon, Waterloo: I didn't think my banh mi tasted like anything? Maybe I'll give them another chance.
* [Miga Japanese & Korean](https://migafoodscanada.ca/): Chatted with the owner, who is ethnically South Asian but grew up in Korea and sold a store in PEI. Had a curry. Decent option.
* [Risposta Bistro](https://www.rispostabistro.com/): On the way to Rattlesnake Point; had been to previous restaurant in that location. Fancy Italian place with tasty but fancy food.
* [Ajisan Ramen](https://www.ajisenramen.ca/): Ramen chain with a location in Waterloo. Maybe I should have had ramen, not fried rice.

Wellington, Whitehorse, Vancouver, and back to Wellington:
* [Leafee Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/leafeecafe/?hl=en): a nice change in scene from The Shepherds Arms on Tinakori Road in Wellington; lighter fare, I feel.
* [Völco](https://www.instagram.com/volcodoughclub/?hl=en): (no picture) I've noticed this popping up in a bunch of locations. Had a pie from the Kelburn location, which is one of the more premium pies available around here these days.
* [Desycan](https://desycan.com): now to Whitehorse; fried fish was a smaller portion than a main, and tasty, though of course fried.
* [Dirty Northern](https://www.dirtynorthernyukon.com/): excellent arctic char, but really noisy especially with the baseball game.
* [Kita](https://kitawhitehorse.ca): hyped Japanese food which legit lived up to the hype.
* [Airport Chalet](https://www.airportchalet.com/): someone told me to try the milkshake and I'm glad I did; would go there even on the not-hotel-restaurant scale.
* [BC Momo](https://bcmomo.ca/): momo not shown but eaten; also lives up to high ratings. Modest restaurant.
* [Satay Malaysia](https://www.sataymalaysia.co.nz/): best roti canai in Wellington according to [The Spinoff](https://thespinoff.co.nz/kai/30-12-2023/wellingtons-roti-canai-combos-ranked-from-worst-to-best-2) (more about [Mayalsian in Wellington](https://thespinoff.co.nz/kai/07-01-2025/how-wellington-became-a-cornucopia-of-malaysian-food-2)). Sure, I'll buy that.

## Volunteering

This was a low-volunteering month, apart from showing up to referee at the Ontario Open. Just [OAC survey](https://www.ontarioallianceofclimbers.ca/2025/11/03/fill-out-the-oac-2025-climber-survey/) updating, a Board meeting, and a FAUW governance committee meeting.

# Conclusion

That really was a lot of effort on the NSERC Discovery Grant, as well as a North American tour.
