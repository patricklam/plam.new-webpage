So here I am staying in a hotel in Burnaby BC. Outside my window I can see a "Save-on-Foods". Hmm. Let's see. Save-on-Foods. Burnaby. Wait! I remember something from the <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Canadian-Professional-Engineering-Geoscience-Practice/dp/0176415947">Professional Practice Exam</a> book! [edit 2020: This was well before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algo_Centre_Mall">Algo Centre Mall</a> collapse in Elliot Lake.]

OK, so is that the Save-on-Foods in question? Google Maps tells me that my hotel is 0.3km from the Save-on-Foods in Station Square, as described below.

Well, it sure beats the view of a brick wall I had once in a Vancouver hotel.
