I was away for a lot of July, but still managed to do a quick turn on
the core Olympus photos, as well as Bromont photos. Did a bunch more
pictures from 2023 and incremental progress on the Estonia and Seoul
trips. I am, however, sure that I took more pictures than I processed,
including 41GB of TMB photos.

* [Back to Prionia, July 12 (67/206)](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/2112)

First of two European mountain trips this summer. Estonia doesn't really have mountains though I did get to that highpoint, so I have my first two country highpoints this summer.

# Canada

Some pictures from the 2023 archives. Almost done with that year. Except for the New Caledonia trip, and a bunch of other sets.

## Pacific International, Abbotsford (January 2023)

* [Pacific International (54/104)](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/2100)

Next year this tournament is returning to Richmond, so I plan to go. The air quality in the venue in Abbotsford
is abysmal and I almost surely got COVID there.

## Kingston RMC (March 2023) and to Ontario (September 2023)

* [Kingston RMC (12/23)](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/2105)
* [To Ontario (30/51)](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/2102)

The September "To Ontario" set is part of a trip to Calgary, Seattle and Squamish,
which I still need to get to.

## Bromont (July 2025)

* [Bromont (63/272)](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/2111)

More Canadian content, newer, with quick turnaround.
