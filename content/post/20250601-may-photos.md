I added 19 sets of pictures and processed 19 sets of pictures, so breaking even I guess? Still, I processed some quite big sets of pictures from the past and probably the backlog is smaller than it used to be.

[Picture
logs](https://www.github.com/patricklam/picture-processing-logs) still
available. As always, pictures are clickable to go to the full gallery.

# Wānaka skiing (August 2023)

Still a couple of days to process from this trip, but here's some progress. This was where we saw the kea that just didn't have enough mass to move the log. I don't know how to embed video, but I can [link to the video](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/picture.php?/34649/category/2063). (Doesn't work on my computer, but works on my phone.)

# Kapiti Island (June 2024)

Kapiti Island really has a lot of birds and was the first place that we encountered a kākā in Aotearoa. In fact
there was one that had figured out zippers. The overnights from Kapiti Island Nature Tours are pretty pricey, but
I was reading my email and noticed an ad for 50% off, so we booked that for Winter 2024. We saw a lot of birds!
Not really any new ones, but certainly some better pictures than I'd had previously. I just uploaded to iNaturalist
and somehow those pictures got a surprisingly large number of IDs (6 or 7 in some cases).

Oh, and the staff were friendly and the food tasty as well. Maybe the room was not quite one would hope for given
the price, but fine for us.

# Gisborne/Cooks Cove (December 2024)

One of the last places in Aotearoa we haven't visited. It's actually kind of far from Wellington, or anywhere, really.

* [Cooks Cove and Gisborne (44/128), December 1](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/2065)

# Two days from Tahiti (December/January 2024)

Continuing to make piecemeal progress on the heap of trips, here are two days from Tahiti, though
we really preferred Moorea (not yet shown).

* [Mostly Papeete Market (34/124), December 31](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/2069)
* [A rainy walk to O Belvedere (52/125), January 1](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/2062)

# Lima (April 2025)

A trip to attend the IJF/PJC referee seminar in Lima; it's the second time I've been to [Peru](https://gallery.mpdesjardins.ca/index.php?/category/32),
though we mostly skipped Lima last time. I also took a day trip to Paracas and saw some birds. They're almost all different from those around here (whereever here is).
