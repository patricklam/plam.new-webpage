summary:    "The planned logistics for the Gillespie trip were simple: rent a car, stay at the [Wonderland Lodge](https://www.wonderlandlodge.nz) in Makarora the night before, take a jetboat across the river, walk, and take a jetboat back from Kerin Forks. The jetboat avoids the biggest river crossings.  Ironically, the day before we were to go, we got a call saying that there wasn't enough water to run the jetboat. That's fine, it should be easy to cross the river in that case."

So, we meant to do the [Gillespie Pass Circuit](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/mount-aspiring-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/gillespie-pass-circuit/) including Crucible Lake. Instead, we did:
* [Blue Pools Track](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/mount-aspiring-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/blue-pools-track/)
* [Brewster Track](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/mount-aspiring-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/brewster-track/)
* [Rob Roy Track](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/mount-aspiring-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/rob-roy-track/)

The planned logistics for the Gillespie trip were simple: rent a car from Queenstown,
stay at the [Wonderland Lodge](https://www.wonderlandlodge.nz) in
Makarora the night before, take a jetboat across the river, walk
across the pass and to Crucible Lake, and take a jetboat back from
Kerin Forks. The jetboat avoids the biggest river crossings across the Makarora.
Ironically, the day before we were to go, we got a call saying that
there wasn't enough water to run the jetboat. That's fine, it should
be easy to cross the river in that case.

At Wonderland, accommodations aren't actually in a lodge. They're in
cabins or chalets. The price is good and the Internet is fast (though it doesn't reach the cabins; I had to hang out in the kitchen/communal area).

I'd figured that things could happen on Gillespie, so that in addition
to renting a PLB, I bought flexidate ZQN-WLG returns on Air New
Zealand. Notably, when you get a flexidate, you can no-show the flight
and still change it, paying the fare difference. Turns out this was
foresighted (we didn't no-show, but we needed to change flights). Also we had more gear than usual: bivy sack, ground pad. More weight, not my favourite.

(Pro-tip: if you want to change to the first flight out on a flexidate, you can
change to the cheapest flight still available for today and then it
becomes a free same-day confirmed change to the closest flight. Currently all flights
are changeable for fare difference between days, but not same-day unless flexitime or flexidate.)

# No Gillepsie

After taking the jetboat, we were going to go to [Young
Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/mount-aspiring-national-park/things-to-do/huts/young-hut/),
then [Siberia
Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/mount-aspiring-national-park/things-to-do/huts/siberia-hut/)
for two nights, then out. But MP was feeling an oncoming cold and on day T-1 MetService was
predicting 116mm of rain at Siberia
Hut when we'd be walking across the pass to there (day T+1). And we wouldn't be able to
check weather updates once we got to Young on evening T+6h.  DOC and Wilkins River
Jets said that we could probably do it but it didn't sound like much
fun. So we cancelled. I hate cancelling. (Tip: if it's a weather
cancel, do it on the phone with DOC to get a full refund). We thought about pushing the
Circuit back (by which time MP's cold might go away) (it hasn't, not fully) but then Easter
was going to make things expensive and it would have started to push
up against the next trip, originally scheduled for a week after
returning from this one.

Wilderness Magazine does say: "You'll want good weather to
safely cross Gillespie Pass."

Alas, I don't think it rained after all. Even the morning that we were
scheduled to depart, the rain forecast dropped to about 10mm for day
2. Maybe the views still wouldn't have been great. I do wish I had
brought more gear though (particularly climbing gear and better
headphones). Fortunately at least I had my computer.

# The Alternative

Since we weren't on the Circuit, we stayed in the Wonderland restaurant for quite a bit the morning
after to figure out the plan. Had a good venison pie. We actually started to set out for Lake Tekapo
but I didn't want an extra 3 hours in the car. There were surely more things to do around where we were already.

I figured we could first do river crossing practice across the
Makarora River, which will ideally give MP more confidence about
these. We had somewhat prepared by getting river shoes, which is a bit
trickier off season. Indeed, part of our logistics upon landing in
Queenstown was to call around and proceed directly to a Wanaka gear
store, where we picked up some sandals just before they closed.

Before the river crossing, we also went to the [Blue Pools](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/mount-aspiring-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/blue-pools-track/), which are pretty.

Having cancelled the Circuit, we then stayed an extra night at
Wonderland (and I had enough time to record and upload my [weekly
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zabXjkMjH6o), whew; different
scenery than usual). 

# Brewster and Rob Roy

We then did an out-and-back to [Brewster
Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/mount-aspiring-national-park/things-to-do/huts/brewster-hut/),
leaving around 1pm.
Before that, I worked on a paper with my student David in the morning, figuring
that it was a short walk to the hut for the afternoon.
Staying at Brewster Hut was easy: just needed to book online at the
DOC site. 
We did
the walk up in about 3 hours.

Alas, I regret not leaving earlier and
visiting the glacier; the map showed that it was just 1.5km and not so
much elevation from the hut, but we walked that way for 45 minutes and
quit. It was hard to find good information about how far it was from
the Intentions Book in the hut; lots of people said they'd went, but I had no clue how far it was. The Internet suggests 1.5 hours to the
glacier, so we would have been pushing it for sunset. We had said we could try again the next morning, but the weather wasn't favourable, as I feared. Mount Brewster would
be a good introductory mountaineering objective, above the glacier, just shy of another 1000m up from the hut.

I was experimenting with the new superzoom and taking pictures of the waterfall of Brewster Glacier snowmelt when 3 keas
flew over my head. I wasn't quick enough to photograph them; I just got some blurry video.

Once we were back off the mountain, I booked a night in
Wanaka and a night in Queenstown.


# Is it COVID?

The cough was a bit worrisome. So, after MP talked to Healthline and
scheduled a COVID test in Wanaka at the local clinic, I changed the
night in Queenstown for a second night in Wanaka so that we'd stay
somewhat closer by. Staying in the same room wasn't possible, but at
least a place in the same town sounded better than changing towns.

With our extra time in Wanaka, I noticed that the Rob Roy
Glacier Track (it's an outdoors
walk and not so crowded) had been fixed since last year, so that was another
worthy walk. Only 400m elevation gain to look at a hanging glacier.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Rob Roy Glacier Walk; entertaining drive to Raspberry Flats with livestock.</figcaption>
</figure>

Although the trips we did were short (25km total), there was still
1400m of elevation gain between them. About half of Gillespie's
distance and height. We'll be back somehow.  Probably next season.

After Rob Roy, we got back to Wanaka just before 9, stopping just in
time for tacos at the truck in Wanaka, then went to our new room. We
got a large room at the Fairway Motel in Wanaka, though the location
wasn't as good as at the Bella Vista from the night before, which was
super central. Both nights in Wanaka were fine, really.

It's challenging to figure out what the right thing to do for flying
with a cold is during this era. Definitely flying while waiting for a
COVID test result is not the right thing. The cold could well take a
week to resolve, so we interpreted the instruction as "minimize
interactions" at least. I conservatively changed the flight to
Saturday, which was the cheapest day.

We were off to Queenstown the next morning, dropping off the bags,
returning the car, and waiting for hotel check-in. Got into our closet of a room half
an hour before announced check-in, ran lecture, and went out to
supper.

Had another call on the Queenstown Bay Beach the next morning, during
which MP got her test results by text. Yay!  Having gotten the test
result, we changed to the next available flight, took the bus to the
airport, and got ourselves back to Wellington.
