We had moved our Cascade Saddle trip from March to May, but we thought the weather might be
questionable in May, so we moved it again to December.

# Christchurch & Canterbury Open, May 17 to 19

On this trip, I first went to Christchurch (well, Lincoln) to referee at the
Canterbury Open, with a stop at Uprising, the bouldering gym, on the Friday.

It turns out that 6:35AM flight to Christchurch was cheaper.
I can't remember how much cheaper. At least with a 6:35AM domestic flight
one can take the Airport Express bus and not just sign over the fare savings
straight to Uber.

Anyway, I got to Hotel Give in Christchurch at 8:40am.  Early check-in was
available. The hotel staff at first quoted $40 for check-in before 9
and $20 for check-in between 9 and check-in time. I said I'd wait
till 9, but then he checked me in early for $20 anyway.  Thanks! Then
I had a nice nap in my room before walking around Christchurch in the
afternoon.

Hotel Give is run by a charitable trust, the [Kind
Foundation](https://thekindfoundation.org.nz/about-us/) (which used to
be YMCA Christchurch but left the Y movement). It was pretty busy. The
standard of the rooms is good. I had a non-ensuite room but it was a
bit weird: it's like we really had our own bathroom, but it was just
outside our door. Also, what's with noisy auto-slamming doors? I figured
out how to not slam them, but it takes effort.

MP came on Saturday and visited
[Willowbank](https://www.willowbank.co.nz/) again while I was reffing
the kids on Sunday. The Canterbury Open was pretty small this year and
I was back in Christchurch by noon on Sunday, at the same time that MP
made it back from Willowbank. We wandered around Christchurch some
more (Hotel Give is centrally located, which is nice), getting Bluff
oysters at Cellar Door before taking the bus to the airport and flying to
Queenstown. The Air New Zealand CHC lounge was good as usual.

# Queenstown outdoors, May 20 to 23

There are a lot of "adventure" activities in Queenstown but we're not
really into e.g. bungee jumping. We have tried riverboarding but MP
sure didn't like that.

We stayed at the [Chalet
Queenstown](https://www.chaletqueenstown.co.nz/), which is pretty
boutique (8 rooms?) and good. There was a couple in the room next to
us having an issue. I would be very wary of calling in, say, the
Montreal police, but, on the advice of the women's shelter (and some
racial profiling on our part), we called them in, and the NZ Police
actually dealt with the situation really well. Unlike Ontario municipal police forces,
who essentially just get to dictate their budgets, the NZ police budget is probably not high enough.

Anyway, our planned activities were Ben Lomond and riding bicycles around.
The weather forecast suggested that Tuesday would be a better day for Ben
Lomond, so we swapped the days, and Around the Basin was cool with that.

## Queenstown Trails biking to Gibbstown, May 20

Biking from Queenstown to Gibbston was, according to MP, just pure Type 1
fun. Nothing sketchy at all. The 300m of elevation gain along the 45km was a bit harder for me,
even though the bike I'd rented was better than my usual commuter.
MP's ebike made things very easy for her. Anyway, there is really good off-track
bicycle infrastructure around Queenstown&mdash;the [Queenstown Trail](https://www.queenstowntrails.org.nz/)&mdash;and the routes along the rivers
are highly scenic.

</figure>

[Around the Basin](https://www.aroundthebasin.co.nz/) runs trips to Arrowtown or Gibbston (and, more
importantly, pickups from those places), but we'd just been to Arrowtown a few weeks
ago, so we went to Gibbston. It has quite a few wineries but doesn't
feel like a place, or even a village. We chatted with the staff wine
guy who had moved to Gibbston from UAE, I think, and somewhere in Asia
before that. Yes, Gibbston is highly scenic, even if there is no "there" there.

These tourist businesses&mdash;Around the Basin, Tamaranui Canoe Hire&mdash;do have a lot of
infrastructure, and guys driving vans around a lot. It is definitely hard to avoid needing
to drive vans around when there is inadequate public transit. Moving canoes is hard anyway, but
moving bicycles shouldn't necessarily need so many vans.

## Ben Lomond, May 21

It turned out to be a beautiful day for a Ben Lomond hike. We left at
7:55, slightly before sunrise, given the 1400m of elevation gain and
short days. Back in town by 16:15, an hour before sunset and in time
to get to the airport to pick up the rental car by 17:00 (though GO!
does do after-hours pickups).

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Skyline sign before dawn; hiking pole assembly; almost clear view of Ben Lomond summit; lake Wakatipu and track and slopes; many valleys (Moke Creek?); us on Ben Lomond summit.</figcaption>
</figure>

The Tiki Trail on the way down wasn't much fun. Apart from that, t
trail was really well-maintained between the top of the cable car and
the Ben Lomond Saddle, and then just well-maintained through to the
summit. I looked into one-way gondola rides, but the website does not
talk about that.

We brought ice axes and crampons but they didn't help and we gave up
on the crampons pretty soon. Some others before us thought they would
be needed and turned back, but they totally could have continued. The
dozen Nepalis just walked up the mountain very fast.

## Welcome Rock, May 22 to 23

After that, we went to [Welcome Rock](https://www.welcomerock.co.nz/)
which is another easy and relatively flat, though long (25km), private
track. We did most of it on the first day, looping around the long way
to the [Slate
Hut](https://www.welcomerock.co.nz/accommodation/slate-hut/).  It's
impressive that the track was constructed with hand tools, though
there isn't the terrain of the Paparoa to contend with: there was only a small amount of rock moving to do.
I would be a bit worried about doing it on a bicycle, but it's well
graded for walking.

The scenery was epic, especially near sunrise/sunset. Since we were
walking until sunset, we did get to appreciate that scenery too.

</figure>

The mattress in the Slate Hut was comfortable. The prefab hut was wired for
electricity, but there wasn't any. The stove was a bit ghetto (it had fewer
than 4 legs), but everything worked, and again, the view was epic.
There was another car at the parking lot when we got back there, but
we encountered 0 people on the track, just some cars (and a helicopter) on the road part of the walk.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Slate Hut kitchen; Eyre Peak; morning mountains; MP; Slate Hut from Welcome Rock; bowl of underclouds; cows.</figcaption>
</figure>

On our way from Welcome Rock to Te Anau, we stopped in Garston for breakfast at
[The Coffee Bomb](https://www.facebook.com/THECOFFEEBOMB/), since we had decided to not
have breakfast at Slate Hut (didn't want to deal with water, gas, and cleaning). Highly recommended.
We had thought about going past Te Anau to walk the Lake Marian Track, but that would have been a
lot of driving. So, we did our laundry at the [Te Anau TOP 10 Holiday Park](https://teanautop10.co.nz/),
which was good to do before going on the boat for 3 days. We also stopped by the
[Punanga Manu o Te Anau / Te Anau Bird Sanctuary](https://www.doc.govt.nz/teanaubirdsanctuary) to see
more takahƒì as well as brown teal/pƒÅteke (both at Zealandia, though I hadn't seen the male breeding plumage)
as well as the Antipodes Island parakeet (not at Zealandia; insurance population).

# Two nights on Doubtful Sound, May 24 to 26

Back in December 2020 we did a [day cruise to Doubtful
Sound](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1329). That's
not long enough given how hard it is to get there (ferry over Lake
Manapouri, bus over the Wilmot Pass, then the Doubtful Sound boat
itself). Real Journeys's Fiordland Navigator operates 2-night cruises
in May (usually they do 1-night cruises), so I signed us up for one
when we decided to change the trip. We had a great time on board,
even though I'm not usually one for cruises. Well, this is a small boat,
just 40m.

We had thought about getting off the Welcome Rock track and proceeding
to Lake Marian, but that would have been a lot more driving, so we
just went to Te Anau and washed our clothes at the [Te Anau TOP 10
Holiday Park](https://teanautop10.co.nz/), where we had a room with
ensuite bathroom. (Slate Hut definitely has an outhouse, not ensuite).
[The Coffee Bomb](https://southlandnz.com/listing/the-coffee-bomb/98/)
in Garston had excellent sandwiches (and coffee, but that goes without
saying in this country). We also stopped by to check out the half
dozen takahƒì at [Punanga Manu o Te Anau/Te Anau Bird
Sanctuary](https://www.doc.govt.nz/teanaubirdsanctuary); this time we
saw them, as well as the Antipodes kakariki (and the kƒÅkƒÅ of course).

Since the boat left Manapouri at 12:30, I had scheduled some calls with
my grad students in the morning, and took those from the holiday park and from
a cafe in Te Anau. Then we drove over to the Lake Manapouri boat. We were on Doubtful
Sound by 2:30, after taking pictures from the usual viewpoint on the Wilmot Pass Road.

I have a lot of photos from this cruise. It's going to take some time
to sort through them. I discovered that the 12mm lens is actually
pretty useful here, because one is often too close to the fjords. And
the 100-400 is indispensable for albatross pictures. But most of the time
I was using the fixed 35mm (on APS-C, so 52mm equiv).

Skipper Dave (with an open-bridge policy, so I dropped in to say hi a
few times) arranged it so that we'd be out on the Tasman Sea around
sunset on both days.  You can definitely feel it when you're on the
open ocean. There were about 10 Buller's mollymawks, a few shags, and
a couple of bottlenose dolphin encounters.

The ship's naturalist, whose name eludes me now, had a good radio voice,
and explained many facts about where we were. He helped drive the boat at times too.
Dave didn't quite have a good radio voice.

The skipper mentioned on several occasions that Real Journeys was a
good company to work for. They'd been family held until the pandemic,
but needed capital to re-launch when tourism started again, and took
investment from [Milford Asset
Management](https://milfordasset.com/). Nothing had changed so far
(kind of like MEC, which has maybe even gotten better under PE). He
had been one of the few to be driving boats during the lockdowns to
transport power dam workers as an essential service.

There was a mix of people on the boat, with some pro photographers and
a handful of serious amateurs; mostly New Zealanders, I think, with
some Australians living in New Zealand, and some from overseas
(notably the US). There was a distribution of ages, too, though it
probably skewed older than the population average. May is not high
tourist season in NZ.

We stayed in a "family-share cabin", which was going to be renovated
away as part of scheduled maintenance this winter. It had four beds (two
times two bunk beds). Not fancy, but comfortable. There are going to be
twin-share and double cabins next season, apparently all with ensuites.
We had shared bathrooms and showers.

## Day 1: to Christmas Cove

The first day was just motoring around to the ocean (way farther than
one gets on a day trip), looking at the scenery and at the wildlife,
and then heading back to Christmas Cove (Precipice Cove on the map) to
moor for the night. We went through the Malaspina Reach and Thompson
Sound, for a total of 80km on the Fiordland Navigator.

Once we docked, Cesar and his kitchen staff had prepared one of our two
amazing dinners on the boat. The first day included mussels, beef, ceviche,
and tasty salads.

## Day 2: water activities and then through to First Arm

While Day 1 was bluebird, Day 2 was cloudy, and it had rained overnight,
so we got more waterfalls. But first, we paddled around Christmas Cove for
5km (or some people took the tender and got narration). There were seals and
there was a double rainbow. When we drove around to waterfalls, I found that
I was often too close for 35mm, but 12mm captures more of the walls. Also, there was
swimming. The water was cold.

Apart from that, we navigated around to Crooked Arm, Patea Passage and
the Tasman Sea, then behind the Shelter Islands for more albatross
spotting, and in to First Arm for the night. That is a total of 92km
on the day, plus 5km in a (not sit-on-top!) kayak.

Our second and final dinner was delicious again, with slow-cooked meat
and a seafood mix, and of course salads.

## Day 3: back to civilization

We left before sunrise and motored over to Hall Arm (where the day cruise goes). We saw the day cruise sailing out
as we came in to Deep Cove, actually. All of the Real Journeys trips do a Sound of Silence in Hall Arm, so we did that,
and heard bellbirds and, I think, a kea. I'd also heard bellbirds on the kayaks.

Then we reversed the journey, back over Wilmot Pass Road and Lake Manapouri, taking us back to town at noon as
advertised.

</figure>

Two hours of driving later, we got to Queenstown, returned our car,
and took our flight back to Wellington without any
complications. Well, getting gas is always a bit annoying, but not a
huge complication. Arriving at 5pm it's easy to take the number 2
bus. Sometimes one can even transfer to the 21 and avoid the walk up
the hill.
