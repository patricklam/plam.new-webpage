summary:    "OK, this month had a trip to Japan. Aside from that, I got to Toronto once, and to Kingston just at the end of the month. February is a short month, though."

### Pre-trip

MP went to Japan a few days before me and visited friends who were
also in Tokyo at the same time, as well as the Koyasan temple complex,
where she greatly appreciated seeing temples (NZ is a bit short on
temples and anything older than about 800 years old).

I took a plane from Toronto to Tokyo which fortunately was only delayed a bit, and then connected
to a plane to Osaka. I almost forgot that I had to change terminals. I got in to Osaka pretty late,
took the monorail, and made my way to the hotel.

Finding a place to store extra luggage was a bit annoying, but we eventually figured that the best way to do
that was to ship it to the KIX airport hotel we'd be staying at after the walk. That worked great and was
cheaper than storing it, in fact. Finding a Yamato outlet near us in Osaka was surprisingly challenging.
We knew approximately where it was supposed to be, but not exactly.

We visited yet another castle&mdash;Osaka Castle&mdash;but didn't go
inside it.  There was a line and we had a train to Kii-Tanabe to
catch. It was definitely a legit looking castle though, and there were
some birds around.

### To Kii-Tanabe

Next, we needed to get to the town of Tanabe so that we could catch a
bus to the start of the trail in Takajiri.  There is pretty much
hourly service on the Kuroshio line from Osaka to these quite small
towns; the population of the Wakayama prefecture is 870k and Wakayama
itself is 360k. The next biggest city is Tanabe at 70k. Hourly
service!

The "limited express" Kuroshio train isn't that fast, topping out at
about 100km/h, but plenty fast enough for us.  It takes 2h11 and ¥5,000 to
travel the 150km to Kii-Tanabe (about the same time by car).

Tanabe has a gear store [Stock Outdoor](https://www.byload.jp/). It
has some not-often-seen outdoor gear.  I bought a [stuff
sack](https://www.byload.jp/items/94618904) which was more expensive
than I expected.  I mention the gear store because the owner also owns
a small apartment ("Wanderers Inn") above the gear store where we
stayed, which was warm and comfortable priced at ¥7,803. Quite large, with two levels,
the kitchen being above the bedroom.  It was, of course, outfitted
with outdoor gear, even if it's indoors. I took a picture of the owner
with my camera and then he showed off his fancy cameras as well.

Tanabe is also the home village of Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of
aikido. But I don't do aikido.  There was a statue of him by the beach
in a pose quite different from the usual pose we see of Jigoro Kano,
the founder of judo. And a dojo. Writing this, I was looking up aikido
in Tanabe, and there is an "[Aikido
Experience](https://www.kumano-travel.com/en/tours-activities/aikido-experience/3567)"
advertised, offered by a 5th dan. Hmm. Wait, who's a 5th dan in judo...?

Finally, we had ¥3,600 sushi in Tanabe, which was delicious of course. We also ordered food
at our minshuku for 3 days after, though it wasn't clear for a few days whether they had
received the order or not.

### Kumano Kodo Day 1: Takijiri to Chiyakatsuyu

First day of hiking! We had an early bus to catch so that we would start early enough for the 16km
of hiking (1000m elevation gain), and we didn't really know about what the terrain would be like.
So we left Wanderers Inn at 6:20am for the 6:50 bus, giving us a bit of time to also buy
some (hot) food at the konbini at the train station.

We were off the bus by 7:35 and on the trail by 8:00, after exploring around the (closed)
tourist information centre at Takijiri, noticing a guy who had camped behind the centre,
and talking to the other hikers who were on the bus with us. They were also going to
Chiayakatsuyu and we'd see them again that day, but not on subsequent days. A stamp in our
Dual Pilgrim books and onto the trail.

This day had fall-like temperatures (though it's technically winter,
at a latitude similar to that of Los Angeles, but with different jet
streams). Not spring yet on the trail.  There were a few birds, which
I totally failed to photograph with my point-and-shoot. Focus fail.
And too small and far anyway. But I can at least ID a daurian redstart
and a warbling white-eye from the pictures, even if they aren't very good.

Of course, lots of shrines, some temples, and historic sites, with
descriptions in English.  The trail is super well-marked and has lots
of "NOT KUMANO KODO" signs as well. It's a class 2 trail at the most,
though mostly class 1. There was one part of it, on day 2, which was
more rugged than a NZ Great Walk, but usually not. Some decent views,
though a lot of forest.

### Kumano Kodo Day 2: Chiyakatsuyu to Hongu

This was the best day of hiking on this trip, due in part to
conditions. It was also the longest day; the materials said 25km,
though Gaia GPS reported 30km.  It had snowed the night before and so
everything in the morning was covered in white, making it really
scenic.  There was a fair amount of road walking in the morning, but
also it was on top of the ridge and we got views off to our right.

The ridge views were probably the best views on the whole trip, even
if they were from the road. We saw a lot of north-facing slopes
(northern hemisphere) which still had snow. Didn't really see more
later on in the trip.

It is acceptable for the pilgrimage to do just the last 8km of this
day, if one also visits other temples.  But that would be missing out
on a lot.

We again left quite early since the walk was supposed to be long and
the day was short (11h, sunset 5:45pm). Indeed, we left at 6am and
sunrise was 6:37am. We had heard that the guesthouse owners get pretty
worried if you don't arrive by about 4pm.  10 hours should be enough
for hiking 25km and we indeed took 10h15 total time, 8h20 moving time.

We got to the Mikoshi-toge shelter just before noon in a sudden snow
squall. It then got sunny but was cold. Quick lunch at the shelter
(walls but no doors) and then onto the steepest part of the track, but
pretty much no more snow after the pass.

Lots of civil engineering works. Tunnels, stone water channels. I hear
there was a lot of subsidies for those. Maybe too many.

It was a lot of kilometres, but easy ones, until the first great
shrine of the Kumano Kodo, the Kumano Hongu Taisha. The walking was
definitely doable and I'm glad we didn't take the bus.

The shrine was pretty fancy. There's a huge concrete torii in town as
well.  We stayed at Guesthouse Yui in Hongu, up the hill, and had
dinner at the sushi place in town. I think that was our only choice,
but it was good and cheap.
