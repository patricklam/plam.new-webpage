summary:    "Alys Lowth and her party toured New Zealand in the early 1900s and took a surprising amount of public transit. Here, I compare public transit in NZ in 1905 and today. Also: things that are the same (geology), and things that are different (not as much as one would think!)."

I saw a reference on Twitter to this 1906 book, _[Emerald Hours in New
Zealand](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Emerald_Hours_In_New_Zealand_(1906))_
by Alys Lowth, a travelogue about the author's
turn-of-the-20th-century travels in New Zealand as a tourist. I
thought it would be an interesting read, as I've been to [many of the
places](/nz-places) she described, 115 years later. I'm going to touch 
particularly on how she got around the country versus what is possible now.

There's surprisingly many photos for a 1906 book. Some are courtesy of the
nascent Government Tourist department, but others are presumably the author's own.
Must have been quite a production to take pictures back then.

Names are strange. It looks like she wrote under the name "Alys Lowth"
but appeared in the press as "Alys Lowth Adlam". Sure, married names
(I find them strange, coming from Quebec). What is also strange is
that she is occasionally referred to in-text as "Mary", which is
really not the same as "Alys".

There's a lot about the author's perspective on the world that is
quite foreign to me. As Hartley wrote, ["the past is a foreign country"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/258079.The_Go_Between), 
and she was
undoubtedly from a privileged background. Turns out that she did not
have unlimited money, even though the book is sort of written as if
she did; there was an interesting 1909 [court
case](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/CHP19091208.2.12)
about the rights to the book and the printing costs. The write-up
points out that she was highly connected to the Important People in
the colony (NZ was a colony until 1907!) at the time, who did not in the end buy
thousands of copies of her book.

On the other hand, while I've tried to build more wiggle room into my
travel schedules, her highly constrained itinerary is no surprise to
me. Still, the ability to just go on a trip for a year: what do these
people do for a day job? (The travel companions are a navy Captain
and his wife, and a NZ Colonel, with whom the author, presumably a young single lady, was surely not flirting.)

To build this table, I checked out current itineraries using Google Maps 
and my knowledge of the transit system.

# Getting to NZ & initial impressions

Took over four weeks on a boat to get from the UK to NZ in 1907. 
In 2019, it took 5 hours to get from Toronto to Vancouver, then a 2
hour layover, then 14 hours from Vancouver to Auckland (on the same
787-8 Dreamliner it turns out). That's a 32× speedup. (Yeah, sure, the
UK is 3000 miles further from here than Toronto, so 24× speedup if you prorate.)

On the other hand, right now I just couldn't re-enter New Zealand
due to limitations in Managed Isolation/Quarantine space, so I guess
it was infinity times faster to get here in 1907 than it is now.

First impressions: Auckland's International Terminal has this [tomokanga gateway carving](https://corporate.aucklandairport.co.nz/news/latest-media/2008/maori-king-unveils-tomokanga) which I've found striking both times I went by.

Lowth wrote about the delay of the Port Doctor, who would clear passengers for entry
(again an issue now!):

> “You are in a democratic, live-and-let-live country now!” they said. “Even the dock-lumpers do not commence work until eight o’clock, unless they are paid overtime wages, so that you can scarcely expect a Government official to hurry himself!” 

Certainly retail keeps limited hours in New Zealand in 2021: stores
are generally not open past 6 on weekdays, while I'm used to 9pm
Thursdays and Fridays.  It's better for the workers, but
less convenient for shopping.

On the other hand, the UK tourists went and tipped service staff in NZ. Still a cultural difference today.
Tipping still shouldn't exist.

> "[he] assured me that to see anyone shabbily dressed in New Zealand was quite a rare occurrence."

(as compared to the UK!) Funny, a Cook Islander just said that about the Cook Islands. But, sure. I don't really have
opinions on how people dress.

# Auckland
OK, onto New Zealand. First, they traversed the North Island in 2 weeks.

On their first day in Auckland, they took a 20-minute ride in the "big paddle-boat" across the harbour to some place 15 minutes away from 
"Lake Takapuna" (presumably the heart-shaped Lake Pupuke in Takapuna). It now takes 12 minutes to go from Auckland to Bayswater Wharf.

They then went to Onehunga. I misread it at first but I presume they went to Devonport, then back over the water to central Auckland, and then took a 30-minute electric tram to Onehunga. The Onehunga train will now go from Britomart to Onehunga in 22 minutes. I have actually taken that train.

# Auckland to Rotorua

The narrative says that the train journey from Auckland to Rotorua (227km) took all day: they left in the morning and arrived in the evening. The Wikipedia entry on the [Rotorua Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotorua_Express) says that it took 7h30, for an average speed of 30km/h. The [Geyserland Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geyserland_Express) ran until 2001 and took 4h13, so about 53km/h. Old-school trains, including the [Canadian](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1097), seem to run at about that speed over distance.

They arrived in Rotorua after the Red and White Terraces were destroyed (and before the recent eruption of White Island), so
geologically pretty similar to now. The sulfur smell is still there.

# Rotorua to Taumaranui

Getting from Auckland to Wellington in 1906 was actually somewhat
difficult: the [first train
journey](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/first-direct-train-trip-between-wellington-and-auckland)
was in August 1908, though the track wasn't actually quite finished
yet. (See also video [The Silver Spike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYuh0dcphtc)). Regular services started in November 1908 shortly after the last
spike was driven. Express train took 18 hours. Now 11h15, which has been fairly constant since 1968;
someone documented the [history of the main trunk line](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/main-trunk-line/rise-and-fall).

What they did was to go from Rotorua backtracking to the then-major
hub Frankton Jct (Hamilton, still a Northern Explorer stop) and with a
sidetrip to Te Aroha, then back and on to Taumaranui by train. I
couldn't really figure out how long those trains took; the table up
there contains my best guess. The text says that the "express" service
to Te Aroha was slow and local to Taumaranui even slower, with lots of
stops. But the travel companions made the train trip fly by.

There was also a comment in the text that until recently the land
route from Auckland to Wellington was to Rotorua, then from Rotorua to
Pipiriki over road, 240km (vs by train + boat as they did), then on the river to
Whanganui, and then train.

# Taumaranui to Whanganui

Taumaranui to Pipiriki (145km) is now the [Whanganui
Journey](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/manawatu-whanganui/places/whanganui-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/whanganui-journey/),
the Great Walk that's not a walk, on the [river that is a legal person](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/30/saving-the-whanganui-can-personhood-rescue-a-river). It now takes 5 days of paddling.
Back then, it was 1 day of steaming down the river,
including a launch that got them from Taumaranui to the steamer, over the now-infamous Whanganui Journey rapids ([50/50 rapids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=443U4oGeUis)?)

Like all the Great Walks, I've heard great things about the Whanganui Journey, and
the text says "... the scenery made up for all these annoyances [on the boats]",
including "foilage [which] was really lovely". However when I'm on the river
I'll be wearing gear and not "travelling rugs" as they did. It'll be interesting
to compare my experience with the one from 1906. The author mentions comparisons
in her guidebooks to the Rhine and how it's not at all like that. Comparing NZ to Europe
really is not the right thing.

I haven't been to Taumaranui yet. The text says that they were not thrilled
with the quality of the lodging in Taumaranui, but that was just after the construction of the railway. There are now 10 hotels there.
Being the terminus of the river journey surely helps.

They then stayed overnight in Pipiriki, the other end of the Whanganui Journey, noting that
it had decent tourism infrastructure. Today jetboats go upriver to the Bridge to Nowhere, halfway along the
Whanganui Journey trip.

At the time there were a number of boats going from Pipiriki further down the river
all the way to Whanganui, leaving mid-morning and arriving early
afternoon. Today there appear to be 0 boats ([someone
tried](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/whanganui-chronicle/news/whanganui-riverboat-tourism-venture-on-the-rocks/X3AWIV5SVRXTDY2UMMOEEA5O3Q/)
in 2010 from Whakahoro to Pipiriki), but there is a bookable [mail
bus](https://www.whanganuitours.co.nz/original-mail-tour/) that takes 3 hours (or 1.5-2 hours in your own car).

# Whanganui to Wellington with a side-trip

From Whanganui it was a side-trip up to New Plymouth to see Taranaki and back to Wellington, all by train.

The author writes about how NZers didn't check luggage but they did; they also outsourced luggage delivery
to the N.Z. Express Company. Me, I try hard to not check luggage. (Sometimes I have to, e.g. when I have climbing gear.
When hiking the idea is to not have too much stuff anyway.) However, the author mentions that luggage pickup is chaotic.
These days it is invariably well-organized and fast in New Zealand. Unlike Toronto Pearson!

OK, so this phenomenon still happens in NZ, and it happened in the
book. "Hullo! old chap! When did you get back?" They are stopping to
take pictures in the New Plymouth countryside. Then Colonel Deane
randomly encounters people that he knows. Not only have I observed
this in places like
[Murchison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murchison,_New_Zealand), but
I've encountered a transitive co-author at a campground. It really
still is a highly-connected country.

The author got offered a chance to [summit Taranaki](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1216) with their new friends
but declined due to lack of schedule flexibility. Her loss!

New Plymouth to Wellington was 12 hours of train travel around the mountain and then along the coast. I've driven that distance in
4 hours, which is faster than the train's 6.5 hours in 1975, but less comfortable.

About halfway, near Bulls, one can either continue along the Kāpiti
Coast, or one can go through Palmerston North and then through the
Remutakas. (Today, there are indeed still passenger trains that go through to
Waikanae on the coast and Palmerston North inland, with possible plans
to go on to Levin on the coast). The Remutakas are surprisingly gnarly
and driving across them is comparable to driving into Yosemite.
In the event, they were dissuaded from taking the Remutaka route:

> “We would have to spend two hours in Palmerston, where there is absolutely nothing to do,” he said, “and then go on by a wretched local as far as Masterton, where the hotels are not very good, stop there for the night, make a very early start, and not arrive in Wellington until after mid-day to-morrow. The line runs through very pretty country, I admit, but I doubt if you would find the interest that attaches to the Rimutaka Pass sufficient to make up for so much loss of time, especially as you have only a day and a half to spare for Wellington as it is.”

People still say that there is nothing to do in Palmerston (or,
Palmerston North now, to disambiguate from the tiny town of Palmerston
on the South Island), though I sent my camera to get fixed there, and
picked it up in person; also, getting fingerprints for a police
check. We did stay in
[Masterton](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1349)
and the holiday park was just fine. But a day and a half isn't enough
for Wellington.

# Wellington

On the way into Wellington they saw Kāpiti Island off the coast, which had just recently become a native bird reserve (since 1897 per DOC). Native conservation generally wasn't very well advanced for another 50 years, but at least there was that. We saw [kākā and weka](https://gallery.patricklam.ca/index.php?/category/1395), and briefly a saddleback. Also a black-backed gull. There are also red-crowned kakariki, little spotted kiwi, and kōkako, but we didn't see any of them (and we'd have to stay overnight to see the kiwi, which costs $400 per person, yikes. [Zealandia night tours](https://www.visitzealandia.com/zealandiabynight) are much more accessible though less of an experience.)

Let's wrap up this post with Wellington and write another post about the South Island. It's already long enough!

Of course, "Windy" Wellington gets mentioned. Living in Kelburn on one of the highest ridges was extremely windy. We're a bit
lower now so it's just windy, not extremely windy.

There's talk about how Lambton Quay was reclaimed from the sea (there are signs to that effect now, "shoreline 1840", and a
[heritage trail](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=81c630e02343443abe71b5dd1d9226de)).
Of course it had electric trams on it: "there is a splendid service of electric cars." If only. Maybe
one of these days with the new [National Land Transport Plan](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/126303964/national-land-transport-programme-threeyear-plan-to-spend-243-billion-on-transport-services-and-infrastructure).

> "The town is beautifully clean and well-kept, especially the wharves; the streets are wide, the buildings a credit to the enterprise of the citizens, who have to take possible and probable earthquakes into consideration."

Yep, all of NZ is relatively clean (though there are always [exceptions](https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/travel-troubles/126316700/poo-in-a-loo-and-dont-leave-your-rubbish-doc-rangers-tell-trampers)). I find the streets to be a bit narrow to drive along comfortably. (I think that's actually a good thing: it provides traffic calming. Besides, I never drive here anyway. I'd say that my state is not calm, though, when I do drive in Wellington.)

Earthquakes, though, you might ask people who are trying to use the [Wellington Central Library](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/418205/quake-prone-wellington-library-to-be-refitted-council-decides) about that. They thought it was good but Kaikoura and Christchurch suggest not.

The cable car which is 50m from my place was already there. The hills are still green. They went to the predecessor of the [Te Papa](https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/) and were duly impressed by the Maori content.

> "So we had to submit, and went shopping, extremely sceptical as to the prices and quality and style we were likely to find. And to our surprise we found the shops very up-to-date, and the prices remarkably moderate considering the high duties levied on all imported goods, and especially on ready-made clothing of all descriptions, including gloves, hosiery, and foot-gear."

Hmm, my spouse isn't thrilled with the style here. I can say that the prices of electronics gear are actually quite moderate. I think that they are actually cheaper than in Canada. As for outdoor gear, North America is better, and I have a few things queued up to buy there.

> "The great majority of the colonials begin the day with an early cup of tea, have it again for breakfast, again at eleven, again at luncheon (which is generally dinner), again at 4 p.m., again at dinner, (which is generally “high” tea), and very often end up with a last cup just before going to bed!"

I think people have a lot of coffee now. I'm told that flat whites are uniformly high quality. Of course I have no pictures of them.

> "But the manager explained that labour is too costly out here for manufacturers to compete against imported goods."

1906 or 2021?
