Happy first day of winter (NZ)! I think I'll continue with split photos posts. I didn't do nearly as many photo sets in May as I did in April, and the hole is deeper, but let's continue digging ourselves out (?).

* Sets of pictures posted: 10 (3 on the last day)
* Total pictures posted: 365
* Total pictures in selection pool: 1635
* Accept rate: 22% (min 11%, max 50%)

As always, pictures are clickable to go to the full gallery.
