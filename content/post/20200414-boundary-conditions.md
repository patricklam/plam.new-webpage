This week's observation is about boundary conditions. As programmers
you have surely run into off-by-one errors. They're hard to avoid!
Somehow New Zealand systemically seems to fudge the issue, as you can
see on this sign on Kapiti Island restricting access to the
tower. Perhaps one can parse this as being "if you put eight plus one
people on the tower it will fall down", but that's not consistent with
the top display. (As an engineering exercise, you can also think
about the safety factors built into the tower's design).

What's the most entertaining boundary condition you've encountered?
