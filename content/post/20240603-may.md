OK, well, let's get started on this month's summary a bit earlier. This is easier since I'm in Wellington
right now and not on a trip.

# COVID


# Professional

need new

Resubmitted two papers, to ECOOP and OOPSLA, and sent a new paper to Onward!.
I think Onward! is actually a strong fit for that paper. I'm not so sure about ECOOP, but we'll
see, I guess; we've tried SE venues for that work and it didn't get in. I also saw similar work
get rejected from PLDI. I'd say that I did a lot of work this month.

It was strange that ECOOP did artifact evaluation concurrently with paper review.
Unfortunately we forgot to hit the "submit" button on our ECOOP artifact.

Quantitatively, worked on 21 days. There are 22 work days in April.

## Grad students/mentees/collaborators

need new

I was talking to my students and collaborators on 13 days, which is
on the high side. Plus 1 chat with a prospective student (who I am not taking).

## Collegiality

need new

Two early-morning PhD comprehensive exams (ugh) and a master's
presentation.  Everyone did fine, even me. I do take a few minutes to
prepare for the exams the day before, and the master's is a day of
reading earlier in the week. Scanned written comments and sent them to
the student.

Also some freelance undergrad advising about how to get into research
and reviewed a course outline for a colleague. (A great thing about
Waterloo from an instructor's point of view is that you don't *have* to
have your outlines reviewed, although maybe the students would benefit).

## Consulting

None this month. Our program design continues to move through committees.

# May posts

I posted a first part of an Overland Track report:
* [Impressions of the Overland Track and comparison with NZ Great Walks](/post/20240511-overland-track-australia-vs-new-zealand)

I figured I'd write this and have the first day of photos processed before writing more about the Overland.

# Miscellaneous

Let's say that I was in Wellington about half of this month when I wasn't away for the Overland or South Island trips. 

## Acquisitions

* [Replacement Sea to Summit titanium spoon](https://seatosummit.com/products/frontier-ultralight-long-spoon)
* [Merino wool gloves](https://www.torpedo7.co.nz/products/T7MRG3V27AA/title/unisex-chunky-merino-gloves)

I was thinking that my thin Arc'teryx gloves wouldn't cut it in the actual snow on Ben Lomond, so I got some
thicker gloves. I figured that wool would be lower environmental impact than plastic. And they were pretty cheap.


## Sports

I counted 17 away days in May, so making it to judo 5√ó is not bad. There was also refereeing at the Canterbury
Open, but that's not actually doing judo.

Climbing was 4√ó at Faultline and 1√ó at Uprising. Let's see what I can do in June with fewer planned away days.
Hard to say if I'm making progress with climbing.

## Restaurants

to do

Whanganui Journey (Raetihi):
* [Coach Caf√©](https://www.facebook.com/p/Coach-Cafe-Takeaways-100044359309214/): Off the river I ordered creamy mushrooms and eggs, and then I had a toasty to go. Both exceeded expectations for the only option in Raetihi in the afternoon.

Wellington:
* [Saigon Taste](https://www.saigontaste.co.nz/): Was there once (when Orange Chinese food truck not available) and the pho was better than at Fisherman's Plate, though I only have 1 data point so far.
* [Graze Wine Bar](https://grazewinebar.co.nz/): Has been open for two years in Kelburn Village, replacing the butcher, but often looks busy (and I was doubtful about the ventilation). We went on a Saturday afternoon and almost had the place to ourselves. Creative tapas-style menu; we ordered chef's choice snack attack for 2 which was more than enough for lunch, though we did get extra bread to eat the sauce with. Butterfish tasty.

Melbourne Airport:
* [Jiro Sushi](https://sushijiro.com.au/location-express-melbourne-airport/): actually seemed to be a good choice, but...
* [Mobo Moga](https://www.melbourneairport.com.au/eat/mobo-moga): "fusion SE asian": wouldn't do that again, and MP was still hungry, hence the sushi.
* Qantas in-flight snack: the cheese and crackers they served us on MEL-HBA was quite appreciated.

Hobart:
* [Suminato](https://suminato.com.au/): we got recognized when we came back the next day; good sushi, grilled eggplant, croquette, and the tempura was just right.
* [Daci & Daci](https://dacidaci.com.au/): have expanded to three locations in Hobart; we had worthy croissants and desserts. Would like to have their high tea!
* [Dubsy's](https://mona.net.au/eat-drink/dubsys): maybe the least fancy place at MONA? has vegetarian food and "invasive species-meats"; a lot of people hate the burger but we ordered something that is actually supposed to be vegetables, which was good.
* [Banh Mi 'N Grill](https://www.banhmiandgrill.com.au/): 10√ó better banh mi than at Mobo Moga, actually tasted like something. Ran over just before closing as MP was trying on some shoes.
* MONA ROMA: they sold me a scallop pie via PA announcement. I don't regret it!

Launceston:
* [Noodles N Rolls-tastic](https://www.facebook.com/nnr.tastic/): legit Vietnamese place, good pho.
* [Alchemy](https://www.alchemylaunceston.com.au/): I had an enormous chicken parm which was also (cold) breakfast the next day; MP had prawn tacos and bao, which were tasty, more reasonably sized and made for a good dinner.

## Volunteering

need new

The usual. Beaver Valley Climbing Festival is taking shape with the
OAC, which is great. I wonder if the Scout group is less cohesive
because there are no regular Group-level in-person meetings. Also
helped revise a Judo Ontario refereeing exam.

# Conclusion

Productive month in terms of both submissions and travel. We'll see how
that goes.
