summary:    "Toula Drimonis writes about immigrants and allophones (non-English, non-French mother tongue) in modern Quebec society, talking about integration of immigrants and how broader society evolves in response. Her story, as the daughter of Greek immigrants, overlaps with mine in some ways."

---

After my West Coast tour and Canadian nationals, I set off for New
Zealand to join MP.  On the way, I got to reading Toula Drimonis's
recent book _[We, the Others: Allophones, Immigrants, and Belonging in
Canada](https://www.lindaleith.com/en/Pages/bookDetail/We_Others)_. Her
story is not quite my story, but there is a lot of overlap.

# Growing up in Quebec

My parents came to Canada in 1975, from Vietnam and via France. I was
born in Montreal and am very much a second-generation Quebecois (also:
third culture), but haven't lived in Quebec since 2007 (as a postdoc
for a year) or 2000 (as a grad student). English is by far my
strongest language, but I've given job talks in French: though it's
not perfect, there is no language barrier. I just make mistakes with
genders. I can speak Vietnamese, but my basic level of Vietnamese
would not be sufficient to function professionally. (I'm sure I could
learn if I had to.)

With my name ("Patrick" being chosen by my parents to blend in), and
having gone to school in the English system in Montreal, I could
totally pass as a typical CBV coming from Markham or something. I can
censor myself and code switch, saying "subway" and "corner store"
instead of "métro" and "dépanneur". (Also, consistent with Drimonis's
nephew being given a Greek name, I notice my cousins giving their
children Vietnamese names these days; also in recent trends, she points
out that more immigrants are being elected than before.)

* NY Times Opinion: [I Got My Name From Connie Chung. So Did
They.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/11/opinion/connie-chung-named-after.html)
by Connie Wang. As a bit of a counterpoint, talks about mostly Chinese
millenial immigrants to the US who all have the name Connie.

But, really, I have much more of a clue about Dollard-des-Ormeaux and
Brossard than Brampton versus Brantford. And the socialist Quebec
society, with funding for social programs, makes much more sense to me
than Ontario's more individualist Protestant approach. Initiatives like affordable
daycare may eventually make it to the rest of Canada, but there is a
lag. What I'm saying is that my spouse (Marie-Pascale, obviously not a
WASP) and I feel more at home in Quebec than in Ontario. There is a
cultural gap.

Still, I can't honestly say that I know the Quebec of 2023. I know the
Quebec of 1995. I've read the 2023 Quebec media to some extent,
including some of Drimonis's columns. But, things have changed, and I
haven't lived the changes. I just visit a few times a year. Zero times
during peak COVID.

I did miss the whole kerfuffle about CAQ and Quebec immigration policy
in the past 4 years. As Drimonis points out, Quebec and Canada need
immigration to avoid demographic collapse (hi Japan!). CAQ kind of
ignored that, as well as requests from business groups and
universities for immigration, and shot Quebec in the foot, before
backtracking (to some extent). Before this whole NZ thing, I really
didn't think much about immigration settings. Now I think about them
more.

# Immigrant experience on easy mode

Aotearoa New Zealand is the unusual twist in my story. We found
ourselves in New Zealand in 2020 and decided to stay there as long as
possible. We now hold New Zealand resident visas, so we can vote and
also, it turns out, be called for jury duty (3 July!). The goal is to
get permanent residency in April 2024, giving us options for the
future.

In some respects it's not at all like Drimonis's tale about her mother
not knowing when she would next see her home village. But then again,
there was COVID, and we wouldn't have been able to return to NZ if we
had left. So it was a bit like that, except, as she points out, there is
WhatsApp and FaceTime.

New Zealand is physically quite far from Canada.  Culturally, it's
part of the Commonwealth, and shares many similarities.  But it is
still a different country! When I'm in New Zealand, I'm an immigrant,
which is a novel experience for me. It's the new-school immigrant
experience, on easy mode, where one maintains ties to the homeland as
well&mdash;in my case, that goes as far as the day job. It's not like
emigrating from Greece to Canada and starting a new life. I know the
dominant language, and I have a salary (which I gratefully acknowledge
happens to be higher than local salaries). I've tried to get up to
speed on Maori culture (e.g. the formal greeting is "Tena koe" not
"Kia ora"); the local politics; and I've worked to be engaged in
society. I know what [Shortland
Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortland_Street) is. But I've
never watched it. And I didn't live through the John Key era.

I find that there are some parallels between Pākehā (white people) trying to have their
kids learn te reo Maori, and Ontario anglophones trying to have their kids learn French.
3 in 5 New Zealanders think te reo Maori should be a core subject in primary schools.
But Canadians outside Quebec don't necessarily learn French that well in school.
The rate of people outside Quebec with "knowledge" (StatsCan term) of French in Canada in 2016 is about 8%,
which is about the same as the rate of people who speak Maori "at least fairly well" (StatsNZ term) in New Zealand.
The difference for French in Canada is the 7.5 million people in Quebec who speak French.

# Thoughts about the book

Now, let's talk about Drimonis's experience versus mine.

## Comparing parents

Drimonis's father ran restaurants and other business ventures, while
her mother was a seamstress. My father instead had an educated
white-collar career, having studied at ETS in Montreal. Drimonis
writes about how her parents didn't understand what she did. At some
level, like Drimonis, my parents still don't understand what I do, but
for different reasons: no one understands what professors do.

About restauranting: my mom did help out at my aunt's restaurant for a
while. It's been sold long ago, but sometimes I pass by the place on
Van Horne. It certainly wasn't the primary thing my parents did, though.

* [Takeout Kids](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/saturday/audio/2018830267/julie-zhu-the-tamariki-behind-the-takeaway-counter), a documentary about NZ kids growing up in their parents' restaurants.

## Economic migrants, and also being an average person

As Drimonis points out, immigration law differentiates between
refugees, family-reunification, and merit-based streams. Both Canada
and NZ generally at least give lip service to our international treaty
obligations to accept refugees. Drimonis strongly defends the
family-reunification stream as well as people who choose to move to be
able to feed themselves, which is economic, but not really. My own
parents chose Canada as refugees.

Drimonis also makes the argument that not every immigrant is going to be
an NBA star, and that this is fine. Some are, of course, and the host
societies greatly benefit from that. But they also benefit from ordinary
immigrants contributing to society in ordinary ways. This mirrors an argument
I've heard about women in tech. It should be OK to not be a superstar, or even
to be somewhat mediocre.

A subsequent chapter discusses the pressure to take up the
professions. True. But, I'm not an MD. It is also true that our
Waterloo Software Engineering classes appear to be full of
second-generation immigrants. ("Appear": we don't collect those numbers.)

## Mythbusting re: Canada the Good

Drimonis writes about how Canada has been, and continues to be, racist.
This is no surprise to me in general. And, really, it should not be a surprise
to anyone, even if Quebec's Premier Legault denies the existence of systemic
racism. I didn't know all of the specific incidents, e.g. the Toronto anti-Greek
riots of 1918. She also writes about the expectation that immigrants show
gratitude; I agree that this expectation is unhealthy and untenable. I contribute
to society and I do not accept that I'm here at the pleasure of the dominant groups.

Of course one cannot write about modern Quebec and not include
Islamophobia.  Drimonis points out that her own Greek Orthodox
traditions are in-your-face on Epitafio (held on Good Friday) with
loud chanting and firecrackers, but no one complains. It's a question
of perception/what people are used to, plus Quebec being traumatized
by its historic domination by the Catholic Church. Also, fake news which
fits with peoples' prejudices spreads fast.

There are occasional lines that elicited a chuckle or more: "Because,
if we're being honest, _few_ Canadians are suited to the climate of
this country!" (in the context of banning immigrants "belonging to any
race deemed unsuited to the climate or requirements of Canada.")

There's also mention of Canada having indeed taken refugees (including
my parents, but also others from Southeast Asia, and more recently).  This
is definitely good, though Europe has taken orders of magnitude more
refugees in the Syrian crisis. Geography speaks.

## Greece vs Vietnam

Drimonis was more indoctrinated into Greek and immigrant Greek culture
than I was into Vietnamese culture. I never went to Vietnamese school. My parents were a lot more
interested in making sure that I could integrate into majority society.
Which I do, in some ways, but also I'm pretty idiosyncratic. ("Very Plam"
is the newest phrase that MP has invented for my antics, which you can
read about in great detail elsewhere on this site.)

</figure>


Indeed, Drimonis's family even temporarily moved back to Greece when she was
eleven, and she opens the book by saying she feels at home both in
Greece and in Montreal. I've visited Vietnam. It's very different
societies-of-origin. In Vietnam I am very much Viet Kieu, or overseas
Vietnamese, ie a guy with a lot of money and a potential mark. I could
feel at home in Montreal, but I don't live there now. Feeling at home
is a whole different blog post, though.

## Integration

Drimonis writes that after the second generation, immigrant
descendants integrate. This is consistent with my experience. All of
my cousins are more or less integrated, and their children even more
so. We grew up here.

Integration, Drimonis points out, also includes widening one's point
of view. That holds for both the society-at-large and the immigrant.
Hummus is great! ("Let's be blunt. If an entire culture is threatened
by a legume, maybe it isn't robust enough to survive in the first
place.")  And immigrants necessarily adjust their own prejudices to
fit in; she includes an anecdote about a Syrian refugee and becoming
OK with a gay hairdresser.

The first generation maybe doesn't integrate as much, especially when
there are cultural differences. I have seen the old men hanging around and
talking, most recently in Brampton, as she mentions.

I hear that this integration-of-immigrant-children is less true in
France, but I have no first-hand experience.  As far as I can tell, it
is generally true in Canada and New Zealand.

Drimonis also writes about layers of identity. Yes, my ethnic background
is part of my identity. Many other things are too, like my profession and my
hobbies.

* On [International education](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/30-05-2023/international-education-changed-india-its-changing-new-zealand-too) by Shanti Mathias of the Spinoff. Not a huge part of my life story except for the studying-in-the-US part, but it does matter to a lot of people. Oh, and the Faculty of Engineering at Waterloo doesn't depend much on international undergraduates. 

## Bill 101

My parents went to some effort to get me educated in English despite
Bill 101. Drimonis went to school in English but her youngest sister
went to school in French. Had I had kids, I could have sent them to
school in French: they couldn't actually avoid having good English,
which was not at all clear for me. And good English is one of my
strengths.

Beyond that, Drimonis defends the goals of Bill 101 and the
francization of Quebec. From here, I tend to agree. One should
absolutely be able to be served in French in Quebec, and I usually
speak French in public. But it does seem a bit unfortunate that people
have a hard time being able to escape Quebec due to the language
barrier&mdash;unless they are a part of the elite.

There is a recurring panic attack about people not speaking French at
home in Quebec, which Drimonis thinks is overblown. As do I. Look, I do
speak English at home, and Vietnamese with my parents, but I can totally
function in society in French. Shouldn't that be what counts?

## Bill 21

"For a province that places large crosses on mountains, it was the
very definition of exclusionary populism," writes Drimonis.

This isn't the inclusive nationalism of René Lévesque, but I'm also
not surprised that a Quebec government could pass such a law. We've
had these discussions since at least the 90s (I remember a photo op in
a CEGEP class where we had a guest instructor with a hijab), and we've
regressed? Drimonis cites the inclusive interculturalism of Lévesque's
PQ as opposed to the exclusive interculturalism of today's CAQ and as
opposed to Canada's multiculturalism. A decade and a half ago I was in
the Orange Julep on Sherbrooke St (closed since 2009) and the old man
working there had expressed the old-school inclusive nationalism.

By the second referendum in 1995, and certainly in the Parizeau
speech («l’argent... puis des votes ethniques») which, of course,
Drimonis quotes, I did not perceive that much inclusiveness.

In the 2020s, though, there are immigrant politicians who support
Quebec independence; Drimonis cites Ruba Ghazal (Quebec Solidaire) and
Maka Kotto (Parti Quebecois). The Quebec population as a whole just
isn't that interested in independence these days, with a 2020 poll
indicating 36% support.

# The same problems everywhere?

I often say that it's the same set of problems everywhere. This isn't
strictly true. Quebec exists in its own context and some things are
different.  I imagine that it's harder to recruit French-speaking
nurses; the Filipino pool of nurses that supplies many anglophone
countries isn't available. Quebec and New Zealand both need foreign
agricultural workforces (the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme in
NZ).

Still, many problems are shared between OECD countries. (The
anglosphere housing crisis, which all Waterloo municipal candidates
talked about in the 2022 election, is noticeably absent from this
book.) Certainly there is contagion from the Brexit and Trump nativist
movements, perhaps the biggest political headache that we're facing
in the near future, and a threat to democracy itself.

# Conclusion

I enjoyed reading this book. It's a quick read, though not a light one, due to the subject matter.
I agree with most of the positions that
Drimonis advocates, and she helped me stay up to date with the Quebec
of 2023. Here's a quote that resonates with me.

"Later that weekend I was at a Montreal wedding where the bride gave a
speech in Vietnamese for her parents, switched to French to address
her brothers, spoke English while joking around with guests, amd then
managed some Punjabi to address her new husband's family. No one
thought anything of it. This is our *normal*."

And this is very much not Toronto. Yes, of course there are second
languages in Toronto. But there's no dominant French/English duality
which allophones exist outside of.
