Following the White Island eruption, the New Zealand Government is soliciting comments on the regulation of adventure activities.
Here's what I wrote:

> I'm very worried about collateral damage to private activities not envisioned by this scheme. Everyone is generally supportive of 
> these activities but making it harder to access lands will affect opportunities for private recreation.

> From the point of view of a private participant: The onus should be on the adventure operator, not the landowner, to manage risks 
> associated with their use of lands. I don't want to see anything that might have unintended consequences and result in fewer
> recreational opportunities being available to the general population.

> Although I'm currently in New Zealand, I also serve on the Board of Directors of the Ontario Alliance of Climbers, which is similar 
> to the Aotearoa Climbing Access Trust.  Rock climbing is a growing sport worldwide and outdoor rock climbing requires access to
> cliffs. In New Zealand, many cliffs are on private lands and we climb with the kind permission of the landowners.

> The legal regimes are largely similar in NZ and Ontario in that landowners are not liable for damages incurred by recreationalists 
> on their land, which is completely sensible. It is very important to not impose additional requirements on them: just securing
> permission to access their land is already hard enough.

> I can support an obligation for landowners to disclose what they know about their land, but I strongly oppose an obligation for them 
> to assess and manage risks of natural hazards, even if it is only for professional adventure activities: this seems to be likely to
> exert an overall chilling effect.
