Bryan Cantrill (of dtrace fame) writes about engineering performance management.

He suggests the following five questions for engineers to answer twice a year.

1. What are you most proud of in the last six months?
2. What did you learn?
3. Where did you struggle?
4. What are you anxious about in the coming six months?
5. What are you excited about in the coming six months?

# Most proud of

Having recently removed the se-director email from my Thunderbird, I
realized that this role consumed a lot of time and energy. I am most
proud of having completed my term and helping students, both in the
moment (advising and leading the advising team) and through program
changes.

# Learned

The deepest technical content I learned over the past six months was
what I discussed with Laurian about the "Proofs from Tests" paper by
Beckman and all. We talked about how their system abstracts the state
space and creates tests to guide further abstraction.

# Struggle

I'd like to help my graduate students become more effective at doing
research. I think that we're having significant struggles with systems
and I hope that I can be more hands-on to help overcome these hurdles.
David and Ali have been in places where working together closely at a
terminal has been useful, and I'd like to continue doing that (remotely).

I think we can use tmux sessions to do so:

# Anxious

Sabbaticals are an excellent opportunity to recharge and to reset one's
research program. I'm pretty sure that the recharging is going to happen.
I'm anxious that the research isn't going to happen as much as I'd like.

# Excited

I think that our research projects are at a stage where it's possible to
make significant progress, and I hope that we can work together to make
this happen. I would like to discover new knowledge, which I feel that
I haven't been doing as much of over the past few years as I'd like.

Specifically in terms of my personal research I want to look at the
broader view of combining tests and static analysis, and exploring
novel static analyses that statically ensure properties that are so
far only tested dynamically.
