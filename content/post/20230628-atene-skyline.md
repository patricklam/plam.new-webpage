This would be our first chance to get out on a longer trip since my
return to New Zealand.  Looking at nearby hikes, I found the Atene
Skyline track in Whanganui National Park, which was reasonable driving
distance from Wellington. I picked up a rental car on Friday night
from Apex (now on Dixon near Courtney Place and colocated with
Budget/Avis) and we drove to our booked holiday park in
Whanganui. With a stop in Paraparaumu to get some boots. Someone
forgot their boots. We got to the Kathmandu just before closing time at 6.

The holiday park is right on the river, but that's not obvious when
arriving after dark.  Except by the name: [Whanganui River Top 10](https://top10.co.nz/park/whanganui-river-top-10-holiday-park)
Holiday Park.  There were a bunch of teens staying at the holiday park
and I was worried, but they were quiet when it was quiet time. Anyway,
we had a good stay there and didn't use the facilities, but they
looked great.

It was almost winter solstice and the walk is advertised as 6 to 8
hours. Typically we land right in the middle of the predicted
times. Sunset was around 5pm, so I figured it would be best to be on
the move by 10am. Wanganui East Bakery & Cafe was open starting at 5am
and we managed to get there by 8:15.  I had a tasty seafood pie and we
got to the northern trailhead by 9am to start our clockwise walk.

I think the most scenic part was the first part up to the Atene
Viewpoint and just a bit beyond, especially in the morning with the
undercast. About halfway through there is a shelter/toilet/water tank
with a logbook, where we could read about quite fast times. Just under
six hours after starting (elapsed time including lunch) we were at the
southern trailhead, 2.2km road walk away from the start. I was quite
happy to beat the published time.  We had 14.3km on the track with
750m of elevation gain/loss, plus the road walk. The track was steep
but well-formed, and serves as a local trail running benchmark, with a
book of times at the trailhead.

The only bird I really saw was fantails. I brought the 55-210 lens
and did manage a few good pictures of one. The 55-210 is viable to carry
around. The 100-400 would be harder to justify.

Overall, a good first visit to Whanganui National Park, one of the
last ones on the list for me to visit. I hope we can do the Whanganui
River Journey this summer.

We then stayed at airbnb in town run by Karen. Her dog was after
cuddles and didn't quite respect personal space; he got right in
there. The cat was also surprisingly affectionate. I really don't have
any problems with the spare room model of airbnb, think it's a good
use of spare space, and is helpful for travellers. It's the ghost
hotel airbnb that is problematic.

We had dinner at Kebabholik in Whanganui and it was good. They were
playing YouTube videos.  What was weird was that I clued in that there
was someone talking about programming language design.  It was Chris
Lattner (of LLVM fame) on the Lex Fridman podcast, [talking about
Mojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWTvXbQHwWs). Then I went back to the airbnb and
finished the words on the May summary.

The next day, we went to Bushy Park. It's also near Whanganui, but in
a different direction. We had breakfast again at the Wanganui East
Breakfast & Cafe and headed out to the fenced sanctuary. We heard a
lot of birds (maybe even a rosella) and saw saddlebacks (no pictures),
fantails, lots of robins, tui, and I had a kereru dive bomb me. Vague flash
of a hihi.

Then it was back to Wellington with a grocery stop. I actually bought
20L of water for emergency preparedness reasons. Not a fan of lugging
20kg up the hill, and we had a car. Though the cable car isn't that bad
for bringing water up the hill, come to think of it. Returned the car, walked
back to Kelburn, and that was our weekend.
