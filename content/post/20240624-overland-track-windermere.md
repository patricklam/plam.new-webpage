I've realized that I'm still processing pictures from day 4 of the
hike (now onto day 5), and here I am writing about day 2. Better get
through some of those pictures soon; there are still over 700
pictures from this trip that I need to process.

# Lens cap recovery

Although I wasn't planning to go to Barn Bluff, I did get out a bit
earlier this morning looking for a lens cap which I had dropped the
previous afternoon. Obviously, that would work best after sunrise (7:05am). I
did know that it couldn't be too far away, as I had removed it less
than 30 minutes before arriving at the hut.

It turns out it was far
closer; Aidan handed it to me as he was coming back from Barn
Bluff. People left at 5am to get to Barn Bluff at sunrise; it's posted
as a very doable 3-4 hour side trip. Waking at 5 is never my favourite
anyway.

Now I keep my lens cap in my pocket while I'm shooting with a lens. Probably I won't scratch the lens while the camera is on my neck.

# Overland Track Day 2: Waterfall Valley to Windermere

The combination of the elevation of 1100m and the latitude of 41.7ºS
means that it can easily be frosty in the morning, especially since it
had been clear overnight. Sleeping inside means that we didn't have to
deal with either frost or dew on our tents, and the hut wasn't full
anyway. It is quieter outside, but there is more overhead in dealing
with the tent, and we saw some tents drying as we left. Standing water
had some ice on it as well.

Day 2 again has a lot of boardwalk. It's a short day, at 7.8km,
estimated at 2.5-3.5 hours, plus 3km (1 hr return) for Lake
Will. Elevation gain is minimal too, with +175m and -209m.  The book
says "relatively flat and leisurely", which is accurate, and the
terrain is wide open, with Barn Bluff visible for a long time, and
other isolated mountains around us, but not ranges.

# Lake Will

We took the side trip to Lake Will, again with more boardwalk. Saves
sinking in the mud for sure. Lake Will really is in the shadow of Barn Bluff,
though I didn't realize that until looking at the map, and I'd mis-identified
the mountain as Mount Inglis. Barn Bluff seems to look quite different depending
on which angle one is looking from.

There is a dotted line going around Lake Will to Innes Falls, but we saw that
the track got worse (no more boardwalk, overgrown, and swampy), and another group
reported that it didn't get better and that they didn't hear the falls, so
it probably wasn't worthwhile. The guidebook does not mention the falls. The guidebook
does mention that Lake Will is a good spot to stop for lunch, so we did have lunch on the beach.

There are a lot of black birds around. Most of them are currawongs.
But I got a picture of one at Lake Will. Turns out that it had white
eyes, so it's a forest raven, not a currawong.

# Onwards to Lake Windermere

About another hour of easy walking got us to Lake Windermere. It would indeed
be a tempting place to camp, but there's a sign explicitly saying "no camping here".
(There are no platforms and one is supposed to camp on the platforms.) There is a viewpoint
on the lake, though.

"Enjoy a refreshing mountain lake swim on arrival". Well, maybe not in May.
That sounds cold. I think some people did.

Just past the lake, we saw some movement and heard a splash into the creek.

The lake is close to the hut, and we arrived shortly
afterwards. Windermere was another modern hut, similar in construction
to Waterfall Valley. We'd been on the trail for 5 hours, including
Lake Will, so at the upper end of the posted time, though we took
about 2 hours on that side trip.

# Animal spotting

We came back an hour later and saw a platypus swimming away! Other hikers tried
to see the platypus but I don't think they managed to. While continuing to find the
platypus again, I saw something that looked like a rock but moved. That was a wombat.

We were also looking for birds but saw nothing. We heard something, and some other hikers saw it, but I didn't.
