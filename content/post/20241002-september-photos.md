I always say that counting is hard. Anyway, by the way I count it, I processed about the same number of photos in September as in August, but not really, because I rejected some of the photos in previous months. Anyway, I got rid of a doozy of a set: the day on the boat with [Petrel Station](https://www.thepetrelstation.nz/) resulted in 982 photos, consuming 11GB. I kept 72 of those 982 photos. (Technically, I keep them all, but mark rejected photos).

I removed 8 sets from the queue and added 7 sets, so definitely ahead, especially since the added sets should be easy.

# Liechtenstein (April 2016)

I was talking about Liechtenstein with someone and noticed that I didn't get around to uploading my Liechtenstein pictures from my visit there with dom, Ruth, and Lauren back in 2016. I did some re-editing (I had already done selection some time in the past) and here they are.

# New Zealand Nationals (October 2022)

More pictures from the archives, though not quite as old. New Zealand judo national championships from 2022,
only two years ago. Stayed at a nice airbnb (though the people being loud were not so nice, until I told them
"it's 4am, you can't be yelling into your phone at this time".) Plus a few random Christchurch pictures.

# Rotokare and Opunake (November 2022)

MP's dad and stepmom were in New Zealand again in November 2022. November can be a bit wet,
and next time they're visiting in February again. Anyway, we met up with them aronud Taranaki.

# Petrel Station (August 2023)

Yep, this was a doozy of a photo set, but I finally got through the last 300 pictures while I was in Japan, selecting the best 72 of the original 982 photos (and then moving the photos to archival storage, freeing space on my hard drive).

# Lake Taupō (October 2023)

In checking off areas of New Zealand I hadn't been to, Taupō was a notable one. Though it doesn't have that many of the things I like to do these days. We did go sailing on the lake with the sailboat Tiua.

# Rotorua (August 2024)

One of my two trips to Rotorua this year. Went up on the Friday and back on the Monday. Don't rent a mountain bike from Torpedo7, it seems unlikely to fit.
