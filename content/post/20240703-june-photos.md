I'm starting this early, because I am not going to process any more
pictures on June: I'll be away hiking on the Old Ghost Road (which can
be done as a hike or bike ride). I only added 6 sets of pictures so
far this month, though there will be a few more on said Road. You can
now follow the [picture
logs](https://www.github.com/patricklam/picture-processing-logs)!

I posted twice as many pictures in June as I did in May, which makes sense given how much I travelled in May.

* Sets of pictures posted: 22
* Total pictures posted: 704
* Total pictures in selection pool: 2259
* Accept rate: 31% (min 13%, max 68%)

Usually, smaller sets have higher accept rates. It does depend on the subject, though. Bird pictures are going to have a high reject rate. I could compute a correlation coefficient, or I could graph things, but let's not. As always, pictures are clickable to go to the full gallery.
