# Spring in New Zealand
Once again, spent two-thirds of this month in Wellington. The other 10
days were around Christchurch and Kaikoura. Currently no trips planned
until November 27, although perhaps Auckland for not-Nationals judo
tournament in early November.

We are moving 700m down the street tomorrow though. The lease on our
current place ended and so we looked around for alternatives (although
a fun fact is that, like in Ontario, a fixed-term lease automatically becomes periodic upon
completion in NZ and needs to be explicitly non-renewed 21 days before
the end date). The new place should be nicer in many ways although the view
might not be as good.

Started processing pictures from the Rakiura trip but I guess I'm now two trips
behind. At least I have a while before the next trip.

There was a judo camp in Christchurch in lieu of the tournament, which was
hard work. Smaller camp in Wellington as well. So a lot of judo training: in
all, 11 sessions. Would have loved to get another one in Christchurch before returning
to Wellington but the runny nose was a bit worrisome in these days of pandemic, even/especially in New Zealand. Called Healthline
a few days later and they cleared me based on symptoms, although they said I could
get a test for my peace of mind if I wanted. I guess I actually got a cold this year.

The University of Waterloo has officially declared that Winter 2021 will be
mostly-remote, i.e. like Fall 2020 was. So we'll be staying in New Zealand for a while.
Feels like a good call with the numbers increasing again in Quebec and Ontario.
Fortunately, I have a NZ work visa good through June 2021 and MP is applying for
Partner of a Worker Work visa (after waiting on an interim visa for almost 6 months
after applying for a Visitor visa; fun fact: interim visas expire after 6 months).

## COVID-19
Worldwide situation: NZ has no community transmission and continues to
import cases in managed isolation/quarantine (another good reason to not
fly back via LAX). Auckland is still in
Level 2 for now while the rest of the country is under no
restrictions. The number of cases in Auckland from community
transmission continues to decrease (although there were 3 deaths from
the cluster). Masks are recommended but not required on public
transit, though I believe that Air New Zealand requires masks.

I think the major transmission route in most countries is <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fB5pysccOHvxphpTmCG_TGdytavMmc1cUumn8m0pwzo/edit">aerosols</a>,
but there have been two cases in NZ attributed to fomites,
since aerosols are generally well-contained.  The two cases are an <a
href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/122512325/coronavirus-mystery-rydges-case-possibly-linked-to-use-of-hotel-elevator">elevator</a>
and a <a
href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/427446/rubbish-bin-the-likely-source-of-covid-infection">rubbish
bin</a>.

Contact tracing has been relatively effective here, and it looks like
they are tracing backwards to identify sources of outbreaks, as
proposed by <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/09/k-overlooked-variable-driving-pandemic/616548/">Zeynep
Tufekci</a>. There are few enough cases that tracing works; they have now traced and contacted everyone known to be associated with the
recent outbreaks. Isolation also seems to work, with
not-completely-voluntary quarantine of confirmed cases.

Oops.

## Weather

Definitely warmer on most days, though I measured 13.6¬∞C one morning in early September. Power bills:
* Jun: $280
* Jul: $257
* Aug: $228
* Sep: $188

# Professional

* Tried to work on code from the test code refactoring, didn't get very far.
* Spent half a week working on
converting <a href="https://docs.rs/curl/0.4.33/curl/">libcurl</a> code from C++ to Rust for ECE 459.
* Added some related work to the Onward! essay.
* Advised <a href="https://patricklam.ca/papers/20.icsme.nier.hierarchy-analysis.pdf">ICSME NIER</a> presentation by Qian.

I really should write blurbs about papers in the style of <a href="https://whileydave.com/2020/09/24/the-semantics-of-semantic-versioning/">this one</a>. In fact here's my complete list of things to write up:

* Onward! essay (semantic versioning) blurb
* ICSME (test your siblings) blurb
* Photos (Rakiura: about 1500, Canterbury: a lot)
* August trip writeup
* September trip writeup
* Consolidated NZ restaurant list
* Travel philosophy (been in final-drafts form since before the pandemic)
* Greece recommendations (mostly drafted)

Days with work: 19, one more than August, and 21 work days in Ontario.
No NZ holidays in Setpember.

## Ongoing (my grad students)

Definitely more frequent contacts this month, at 14 days. ICSME accounted
for part of that.

## Collegiality

Almost none. One last-minute reference letter for the Waterloo CS <a
href="https://grec.cs.uwaterloo.ca/">Undergraduate Research
Fellowship</a>, a great initiative. Printed out a TOSEM paper to
review.

## Teaching

Definitely <a href="https://www.github.com/jzarnett/ece459">ECE459</a> <a href="https://github.com/jzarnett/ece459/blob/master/RustConversion.md">Rustification</a> took a bunch of time. Content and infrastructure.
Figured out some GitHub Actions as well. I should make a GitHub action for this site.

# Travels

The 10-day Canterbury trip really was action-packed, although it included two rest days towards the end.
Work was 19 and no-work (excluding trips) was 2, although some of the days that I included as work
really were like 15 minutes of chatting.

* üö∂ Walking distance: 105km (no long hikes); two at-home zero days, one travel zero day.
* üö≤ Biking distance: 153km (3√ó more than August, but that includes one 48km day); bike needs wheel replacement more now it seems.
* ‚õ∑Ô∏è Skiing distance: 5.3km? Dunno, one day of lift-served downhill skiing at Mount Hutt.
* üöó Driving distance: 407km (Christchurch-Kaikoura, back via Mount Grey), chauffered 238km to Mount Hutt
* ‚õ¥ Boat distance: 45km, Kaikoura Albatross Encounter
* üöÜ Train distance: 54km to Paraparaumu
* üöå Bus distance: 59km train replacement from Paraparaumu + 18km to WLG / from Christchurch
* üõ© Plane distance: 606km WLG-CHC-WLG

## Walks
* Visited a bunch of Wellington apartments.
* Part of <a href="https://ccc.govt.nz/parks-and-gardens/explore-parks/waterways/avon-river/te-ara-trail">Te Ara ≈åtƒÅkaro Avon River Trail</a> in Christchurch.
* <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/marlborough/places/ka-whata-tu-o-rakihouia-clarence/things-to-do/tracks/mt-fyffe-and-the-seaward-kaikoura-range/">Mount Fyffe</a>, overnighting at hut, best views in NZ.
* Mountain/road biking on <a href="https://kaikouracycling.co.nz/kaikoura-trail/">Kaikoura Trail</a> (ok, not a walk).
* <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/mount-grey-maukatere-conservation-area/things-to-do/mt-grey-maukatere-tracks/">Mount Grey/Maukatere</a>, much better reward-to-effort ratio than Mount Fyffe. Climbed to cell phone tower subpeak, did not summit main peak.
* bit of walking around Waikanae Estuary Scientific Reserve

<a
href="https://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/enjoy-the-outdoors/walks-and-walkways/top-20-welly-walks">Top
20 Welly Walks</a> progress: no new walks since last month, 18 done, plus parts of Mt. Kaukau summit. Still haven't touched the Redwood Bush Loop.

Total distance walked definitely lower than previous months due to no long walks. Even in May we had 122km.

## Rock climbing
* <a href="https://climbnz.org.nz/nz/si/canterbury/port-hills/wunderbar-wall">Wunderbar Wall</a>, scenic moderate climbing in Lyttleton near Christchurch before flying back to Wellington
* Sent shoes to be resoled.

### Canterbury

Longer trip report to come. Posted a selection of phone pictures on Facebook, but just transferred all
camera photos onto computers yesterday. Need to get the Rakiura ones processed first.

## Travel planning
Thinking about Auckland trip in November. Booked Kepler Track flights, car, and some accommodation.

# Restaurants

* Kinji, Christchurch: Best sushi in NZ that we've had yet; we went twice!
* Smokey T's, Christchurch: 4.9‚≠ê on Google, superlative BBQ
* Original Sin, Christchurch: Italian, and good oysters
* Kaikoura: Still pretty touristy even though there are fewer tourists

Haven't managed to go to the Harbourside market since we got back to level 1 yet.

# Conclusion

Worked on the test refactoring code in September but didn't manage to finish it.
ECE 459 and refactoring are my personal goals for October, as well as seeing where
my students can get to.

The Christchurch trip was certainly action-packed.
