I'm still processing December 2022 photos, with three days on the Gillespie Circuit left. The processing rate was also down from November, since I was travelling in December 2024 as well, or sometimes I was kind of staying put in Wānaka/Queenstown but didn't have my computer. Still, it wasn't down as much as I might have thought.

Removed 18 sets from the queue and added 13. After I finish the three last December 2022 sets and the 5 January 2023 sets then I'll get to August 2023.

[Picture

# South Island Adventures (December 2022)

I took some spectacular pictures of Australian crested grebes/pūteketeke before they were cool, including babies.
