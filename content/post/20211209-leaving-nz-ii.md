# AKL-LAX

How had I checked 60kg of luggage? Air New Zealand's checked baggage allowance in
Economy is 1 bag, plus 1 for Star Alliance Gold (AC E50k in my case). But I'd also bid $350
for an upgrade to Premium Economy (aka PY), which came through a couple of
days before the flight. The $1000+$350 flight was still cheaper than
some fares I'd seen at $1500, though I had also seen $800 fares but
missed them for my dates. Air New Zealand oneUp bid upgrades give the
upgraded class's baggage allowance if they clear before the flight;
this allowance was 2. Yay! I could bring more stuff (almost all of my stuff) back to Canada.

Some people really like compression socks for flights. I had
compression socks. I hadn't used them in 2 years, because 1hr flights
don't require compression socks. After boarding, I thought I would put
on the compression socks. Then, I had a moment (uh, 15
minutes) due to the diameter of my calf plus that of the compression
sock exceeding the diameter of my jeans. Yikes. I guess this is a
problem that's solvable with scissors, but then I wouldn't have socks.

I don't do extended reviews of flights, but I'll do a capsule review.
Air Canada's PY has seats similar to domestic AC Business and food
closer to Economy; the main meal is better than Y but served with
Economy wine. Air New Zealand's PY seats are also similar to AC
domestic Business, feeling slightly less comfortable than I remembered
on AC, but more comfortable than Economy for sure. The meals are much
better than Economy and not quite as fancy as AC Business, with the
good wine for dinner and a full breakfast (rather than a slice of
banana bread).

Also, a 12 hour overnight flight is actually quite good for sleeping.
I feel like the trans-Atlantic flights from the East Coast of North
America are too short for a good night's sleep (Toronto to Paris is
7h15).  I felt much more rested after this flight.  My
noise-cancelling earbuds are good. The P2 mask isn't super comfortable
but I wore a cloth mask most of the time (the flight was coming from
mostly COVID-free NZ after all) and switched to the P2 mask
just before deboarding.

# Twenty Hours in Los Angeles

Landing at LAX felt a bit like rejoining the rest of the world,
starting with the Emirates liveries I could spot on planes. Seeing
planes other than Air New Zealand and Jetstar plus regionals has been
rare for the past two years.

Thanks to Global Entry, I got to baggage claim in 20 minutes
without speaking to anyone. I just used the customs declaration
machine, scanned my passport, and showed my receipt to the US Customs
and Border Protection officer. I was one of the first
people at baggage claim.

It took a further 15 minutes for my baggage to come out (it wasn't
one of the first) and another 25 minutes to take the shuttle out to
the Alamo desk. It took me a while to operate the kiosk somehow,
but all together it was another 18 minutes until I was at the car.

With the car, I could drive to Irvine for dinner with
Brian. Fortunately, I didn't need to drive to Panorama City for a
COVID test, having [planned out things correctly](/post/20211127-pre-departure/). It was miles upon
miles of LA-area highways, pretty dysfunctional. I guess that in a
normal place, one wouldn't think that Irvine is quickly reachable from
LAX. Maybe it isn't really reachable. We do things because we can
(even if it sucks). Induced demand at work. Like, if the way to go there was by train,
and the train schedules don't allow, then one just wouldn't go. Which is probably a plus.

First food in the US was a gyro pita, eaten outdoors, at Luna Grill. I
guess that I am literally writing home about it, but would I? Probably not. It
was pretty good.

Back to check in at my motel (not as nice as a NZ hotel and slightly
more expensive at C$105 vs typically NZ$90, but 15 minutes from LAX)
and then out to Santa Monica to meet Jon.

Since there's still a pandemic going on, we walked around Santa
Monica, including the pier and the pedestrian zone. It does close
fairly early at night. Not bad, not super compelling as a
destination during a pandemic (what is?), but pretty safe.

# The morning after

Next morning I went to get gas (see table below), picked up
a rapid antigen test at the pharmacy (hard to get in some parts of Canada), and
proceeded to the airport. Returning the car was much faster (8 minutes
and the shuttle left instantly) and I got to the airport in 16
minutes, with time for a quick stop at the Air Canada Maple Leaf
Lounge, where I ate food without a mask in a place potentially with
COVID. Eeps.

While checking in, I saw two parties who had to reschedule their flights due to
having expired COVID tests. It was really Someone Else's Problem so
I don't exactly know what happened, but it didn't seem awesome for them.

I managed to upgrade my flight LAX-YUL and had an enjoyable flight.

# YUL

I spent 35 minutes at Montreal Trudeau airport: used the NEXUS
machines, waited 20 minutes for my luggage, and got another test on
arrival. There was some confusion because I'd used the NEXUS machines
and hence Canadian customs hadn't put any stickers on my passport, but
they figured it out. This was just before Omicron and having to wait
until test results come back (still not sure how that's
implemented). My test came back negative around 19 hours later.

The test people referred me to the Public Health staffer to double-check
my vaccination record. But I had to wait while a French-from-France immigrant
was complaining about not being able to leave the country without vaccines.
There was a race issue as well, since it was a white French woman ranting to the
black Public Health public servant.
I couldn't help pointing out that her rights to not be vaccinated were subject
to reasonable limits.

60kg of luggage is too much for taking the 747 bus so I took a taxi to my
parents' house (which would not be a suitable place to quarantine,
since my parents are over 65). My parents' place also isn't a great place to sleep,
but that's another discussion. Getting there at 7:45PM is completely 
reasonable.

And that's how I got back to Canada.

# Postscript: To Kitchener

I had a few adventures in Québec which will show up in my December
report (reffing in Repentigny, visiting Québec City, taking the train
back) but I eventually made my way back to Ontario with my
fully-loaded car. Getting out of Montreal was annoying, mostly but not
completely due to forgetting stuff at various places. I mailed some
gifts and took advantage of a stop in Outremont to pick up a dozen
[St. Viateur](https://www.stviateurbagel.com/en/shop) bagels. I almost
forgot stuff I'd left at my parents' place, but my dad reminded me
just as I was about to leave there.  I finally managed to leave
Outremont at 11:07, which I felt was pretty late, but did give traffic
a chance to dissipate.

I stopped in Kingston for gas but not food. Along the way I ate 2
bagels. I wouldn't buy blueberry bagels from them again. 

I then drove through
to Mississauga, where my aunt was enthusiastic about seeing me and had
supper ready. This is the aunt I stayed with during kindergarten to
get me into Quebec English school. She even brought out tea that my
grandmother had imported from Vietnam back in 2005 and that she'd been
saving since then.

But the snow was coming and I left Mississauga at 7:15pm for a
slightly sketchy 1h15 drive. I stopped once again in Kitchener to drop
off some bagels with friends (and also to store some luggage so that I
wouldn't need to lug them through the Kaufman lofts). I was a bit
worried about a master's thesis I had to read before the seminar the
next day, but still stayed there for 2 hours. Oops. Then I finally got
in to the place that I'm housesitting.

Long day, no pictures. Driving on the 401 is definitely not a NZ
experience, and one I really don't miss. COVID willing, I'll be going
back to Montreal by train in a week for a judo training camp.

# Reverse-engineering how we got here

My dad also pointed out that MP's bike was at their house. I had
totally forgotten about that. Foresight! We'd planned to be in
Montreal for the summer of 2020. Ha. So I had prepositioned it there
in November 2019 by biking to the Kitchener GO, taking that train, and
then the VIA Rail train, locked the bike up downtown for the weekend
while refereeing in Deux-Montagnes, and finally brought the bike to my
parents' house.

As for the luggage on the way to NZ, we had brought it to our friends' place
in Toronto, then driven the car and some stuff to store to Montreal, taken the
plane back to Toronto, picked up the luggage, and flown out. This was almost two years
ago and I'd completely forgotten the logistics! I thought we still had luggage in Toronto,
but nope. 

I still don't know where all my stuff is, though. My summer bike, in particular, is an open question.
