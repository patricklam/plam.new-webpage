In the event, we're happy to have done 5 of the Great Walks so far. The huts are indeed quite comfortable and the rangers are helpful. I've heard of the track described as sidewalk-like and it is certainly generally but not always well-groomed. It is always at least somewhat groomed; the second day of Rakiura was muddy and Milford had a bit of terrain. I appreciate the scenery a lot, although Canada has excellent scenery too. Canada has birds&mdash;more colourful ones&mdash;but it doesn't have keas.

Initially we had planned on doing 0 Great Walks. We thought they'd be overrun. We didn't know the full story and we weren't going to be in New Zealand for that long anyway. Certainly we wouldn't have been able to do Milford but we probably could have done [Heaphy](/post/20200905-heaphy-track/). Milford also probably would not have been worth $140 per person per night; even the Department of Conservation (DOC) acknowledges that the 2&times; visitor pricing wasn't value for money. It was definitely worth $70 per person per night. (And, DOC apparently loses money on maintaining the Great Walks. Flying people out certainly doesn't help.)

I usually like to go to the second-tier "attractions". I'm not so much into "must dos" (NZ tourism term!) especially as decided by tourism boards. We did a lot of day walks and some overnights (e.g. [Cape Brett](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/northland/places/cape-brett-and-whangamumu-area/things-to-do/cape-brett-track/), [Silverpeaks](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/silver-peaks-scenic-reserve/things-to-do/silver-peaks-routes/), [Mount Fyffe](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/marlborough/places/ka-whata-tu-o-rakihouia-clarence/things-to-do/tracks/mt-fyffe-and-the-seaward-kaikoura-range/), [Pouakai Circuit](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/taranaki/places/egmont-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/pouakai-circuit/)).


It's really nice to not have to carry a tent and to be able to stay in a hut which comes with a mattress (especially since I didn't bring my new tent to NZ). We had many positive experiences with huts and two less-positive experiences: the Pouakai Hut was overrun on the first nice day in June (being 2 hours from the road doesn't help), and the Atiwhakatu Hut looked like it was going to be a noisy night with 10 kids (in level 2!) We were also at the Iris Burn hut and a high school trip came by with a dozen kids but they were exceptionally well-behaved. So that was good.
