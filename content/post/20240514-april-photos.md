Let's try something different and separate the photos post from the summary post. There will still be photos in the summary post, mostly of travels in the month. But there's also the pictures that I've been doing from the backlog, which is this post. Some good progress here, though still an enormous backlog. As always, pictures are clickable to go to the full gallery. This month, I included stats on how many pictures I kept versus how many I took after the album name (x/y).
