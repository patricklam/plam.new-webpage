"That's a nice couch in your office, Patrick."

When I moved into <a href="http://eh.mit.edu">Edgerton House</a> I
realized that trying to live without furniture soon becomes deeply
unsatisfactory: the floor just isn't that great to sit on. To avoid a
repeat of that experience, I quickly purchased furniture for my new
place.

I found ads for a coffee table set and a couch on craigslist, which
were actually posted by the same person. Better yet, this person had a
van and offered to transport the furniture to my place. She was
selling the coffee table set and a couch set: a one-place, a
two-place, and the above three-place couch. My place is small, so I
negotiated with her to purchase just the one- and three-place couches,
and I recruited Todd (thanks again!) to help me move the couch into
and out of the van.

We loaded the van without incident and brought the furniture to my front
door. I thanked the seller for her help with the van...

... two hours later, after trying all of the different ways (front
up, bottom down; front down, bottom up; vertically&mdash;no, too high
for the porch roof!) to bring the couch into the building, I covered
the couch with tarps to protect it from the rainstorm that night. The
issue was the 90-degree turn required to bring anything inside. The
rain kept me up all night: I worried about my new-to-me couch getting
wet and growing mildew.

Todd was happy to learn that the professional movers I called in also 
did not succeed. ("We don't often get skunked.") It was apparently not just that we were dumb. So, with
<a href="http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~olhotak/">Ondrej's</a> help, I bought
the two-place couch from the seller, brought into my place, and moved
the three-place couch into my office. AV carts are great for moving
couches, by the way.
