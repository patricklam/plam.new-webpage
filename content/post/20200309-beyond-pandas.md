This week I was busy writing code for a research project I'm working
on here in New Zealand, so no travel pictures from me.

Here is a <a

panda</a> in the Wellington Zoo (photo credit: Marie-Pascale
Desjardins, as well as for suggesting this tip).

It turns out that red pandas and <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/giant-panda">giant pandas</a> are not related aside
from both being cute animals. Giant pandas have a <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/endangered_species/giant_panda/panda/what_do_pandas_they_eat/">99% bamboo diet</a>,
while red pandas are at <a href="https://ielc.libguides.com/sdzg/factsheets/redpanda/diet">85% bamboo</a>.

Today's life tip is to have a well-rounded diet. Red pandas and giant
pandas are both cute, but you aren't a panda of any sort. As most of
you think ahead to moving out of residence, Michael Pollan's <a href="https://michaelpollan.com/reviews/how-to-eat/">advice</a> is
good: "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."

The best way to have a well-rounded diet is to cook for yourself (and
your roommates) most of the time. It's a useful life skill. For me,
time spent preparing and cooking food is not wasted; it's a good
chance to get away from the keyboard and doing something in the real
world. You can also cook healthier food than you might buy at a
restaurant and you have more control over portion size. Highly
recommended!
