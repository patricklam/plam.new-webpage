      <description>2019 Travel options to/from Waterloo A lot has changed from the last time I wrote this in 2008. The options for getting to Toronto and Pearson are much better. I went to BUF a few times a while ago but now there aren&amp;rsquo;t good Star Alliance options from BUF and they&amp;rsquo;re not that much cheaper, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t done it for a while.
Here are various options for carless transportation from Waterloo in 2019.</description>

      <description>One of my strange hobbies is walking to or from airports. In the ideal case it is walking between the airport and the place I am sleeping. I flew into YOW in December 2019 and had the opportunity to take a 13km walk.
Itinerary From YOW, out on Paul Benoit Driveway past the Ottawa Hunt and Golf Club, to Riverside Dr, meeting the Rideau River at Mooney&amp;rsquo;s Bay and &amp;ldquo;civilization&amp;rdquo; at Billings Bridge, then across the Rideau on Bank through the Glebe and Centretown to Albert St and my destination.</description>

      <description>Travel options from Waterloo I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to figure out various options for carless transportation from Waterloo. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered.
To Pearson Airport  Airways Transit option 1, door-to-door: 1.5hr, $80 for one direction. You have to wait for everyone to get on and off. They do tend to drive at reasonable highway speed. Airways Transit option 2, Airporter: 2 hours from the UW Student Life Centre, limited schedules (departs 6am, 10:45am, 1:00pm, 3:30pm; returns 8:15am, 1:30pm, 3:15pm, 6:13pm) and even less on weekends.</description>
